## Potential Missing Parameters (compare to source)

- CO2 concentration during incubation (likely 5% CO2) is not mentioned in the generated protocol but is a standard parameter and usually assumed [CHECK].
- The source mentions to avoid overdrying Matrigel during gel formation but no quantitative guidance is given—this is consistent, but no further clarification appears.
- The source protocol notes to keep medium thoroughly chilled before addition of Matrigel in the on-top method; the generated protocol mentions this but not the detailed rationale.
- The source mentions swirls the vial to "ensure material is dispersed" during thaw; generated protocol mentions swirl but omits the detail that the vial is submerged in ice specifically in the embedded protocol thaw step (they say "submerging the vial in ice in a 4°C refrigerator" vs "submerging the vial in a 4°C refrigerator").
- The source mentions use of "pre-chilled 24-well plates" in on-top protocol step 2, and also for embedded protocol step 3; generated protocol reflects this, no omission.
- The specific note "The volume of the cells should not be over 10% of the Matrigel solution" in embedded protocol step 5 is present.
- No explicit mention of CO2/O2 levels anywhere in the source PDF; generated protocol did not add.

## Possible Hallucinations / Unsupported Claims

- None detected.  
The generated protocol closely tracks the source text's instructions and notes without adding unsupported details.

---

## Step Order / Omission Risks

- None detected.  
The step order matches the source instructions as presented.  
All critical steps (thawing, spreading Matrigel, centrifugation, resuspension, plating, incubation times) are present and in the correct sequence.

# Summary

The generated protocol accurately reflects all critical numeric parameters and procedural details present in the source text and does not add any unsupported claims. It omits specification of CO2 environment, which is not detailed in the source text but important for cell culture [CHECK]. Other procedural notes and parameters are well transcribed. No major risks of omitted steps or reordering are apparent.
