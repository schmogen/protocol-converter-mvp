## Critical Parameters Checklist (from the protocol)

- Matrigel thawing: overnight at 4°C  
- Matrigel concentration:  
  - On-top base coat: 8 to 11 mg/mL  
  - On-top overlay: 0.8 to 1.1 mg/mL (10% of final volume)  
  - Embedded coating and mixture: 5 mg/mL  
- Matrigel volumes:  
  - On-top base coat: 200 μL per well  
  - On-top overlay: 250 μL per well  
  - Embedded coating: 100 μL per well  
  - Embedded cell-Matrigel mix: 300 μL total (30 μL cells + 270 μL Matrigel)  
  - Embedded overlay medium: 500 μL per well  
- Cell densities:  
  - On-top: 3 × 10^5 cells/mL, plated 250 μL per well  
  - Embedded: prepare 5 × 10^6 cells/mL stock; final 5 × 10^5 cells/mL in Matrigel mixture  
- Centrifugation: 125 x g, 5 min, room temperature (RT)  
- Incubations:  
  - Matrigel gelation: 37°C for 30 min  
  - On-top cell attach/incubation post plating: 37°C for 30 min  
  - Embedded gel with cells: 37°C, 30 to 45 min  
- Culture durations:  
  - On-top: 4 to 7 days, medium change every 2 days  
  - Embedded: 8 to 10 days, medium change every 2 days  
- Temperature details for procedure steps: keep all materials and cultureware on ice or pre-chilled before gelation steps  
- Media composition: MEM + 10% FBS (referred to as MDCK complete medium)  
- Pipetting instructions: gently add overlay down the side of wells  
- Cell confluency: use cells not more than 85% confluent  

## Potential Missing Parameters (compare to source)

- CO2 concentration during incubation (commonly 5% but missing in protocol)  
- Exact RPM for centrifugation is missing; only RCF is provided (125 x g)  
- Details on O2 levels during culture are not mentioned (not specified in source, so acceptable)  
- Temperature stated as "room temperature" for centrifugation—no exact numeric range (acceptable but [CHECK] if RT varies in lab)  
- No explicit mention whether medium changes involve removal of old overlay medium or complete replacement (source does not clarify)  
- No details on temperature/humidity/CO2 conditions during 4-7 or 8-10 day culture periods (source only states 37°C)  
- No instructions or specifics about the immunostaining procedure (only recommended; omission probably acceptable here)  

## Possible Unsupported Claims

- None detected. All protocol steps, parameters, and notes are supported by source text.  
- The protocol’s objective and recommended immunostaining/confocal microscopy are consistent with source text.  

## Step Order / Omission Risks

- None detected. Step order aligns well with source text for both on-top and embedded methods.  
- The note about "pipet vigorously to obtain single-cell suspensions" occurs at consistent steps.  
- The caution to avoid overdrying Matrigel during gelation is included at appropriate points.  
- All recommended medium changes every 2 days during culture are retained in correct order.  
- No steps appear skipped or reordered relative to source text.

Summary: The generated protocol is a faithful and safe extraction of the source method with key numeric parameters retained. Minor omissions on incubation atmosphere details and centrifuge RPM may warrant flagging depending on experimental rigor requirements, but no critical unsafe omissions or unsupported claims are present.
