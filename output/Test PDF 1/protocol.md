# Corning® Matrigel® Basement Membrane Matrix for 3D Culture In Vitro Protocol

## Objective
To culture MDCK cells in 3D using Corning Matrigel basement membrane matrix through two methods: on-top culture and embedded culture, enabling the formation of a reconstituted basement membrane for in vitro studies.

## Materials
- MDCK cell line (ATCC CCL-34, Canis familiaris kidney cell line)
- Corning Matrigel matrix (Corning Cat. No. 356234)
- MEM (Corning Cat. No. 10-009-CV)
- FBS (Corning Cat. No. 35-015-CV)
- PBS (Corning Cat. No. 21-040-CV)
- 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA (Corning Cat. No. 25-053-Cl)
- 24-well plate (Corning Cat. No. 3524)

## Procedure

### 1. On-top MDCK 3D culture

1. Thaw Matrigel matrix overnight by submerging the vial in a 4°C refrigerator. Swirl the vial to disperse.
2. Add 200 μL of Matrigel matrix (8 to 11 mg/mL) into each well of a pre-chilled 24-well plate. Spread evenly with a pipet tip.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 min to allow the Matrigel to gel.
   - **Note:** Keep all cultureware/media contacting Matrigel pre-chilled or ice-cold. Keep Matrigel on ice during the process. Avoid overdrying Matrigel during gelation.
4. Wash MDCK cells once with PBS.
5. Trypsinize cells to obtain a single-cell suspension.
6. Pellet cells by centrifugation at 125 x g for 5 min at room temperature (RT).
   - **Note:** Use healthy cells <85% confluent. Pipet vigorously to avoid cell clumps.
7. Resuspend cells in complete medium (MEM + 10% FBS) to 3 x 10^5 cells/mL.
8. Plate 250 μL of cell suspension into each Matrigel-coated well.
9. Incubate at 37°C for 30 min.
   - **Note:** Cell number may require optimization.
10. Chill MDCK complete medium on ice and add Matrigel matrix to 10% of the final volume (final concentration 0.8 to 1.1 mg/mL).
11. Gently add 250 μL of Matrigel-medium mixture to each well by pipetting down the side of the well.
    - **Note:** Thoroughly chill medium before addition. Avoid disturbing cells or the Matrigel.
12. Culture continuously for 4 to 7 days.
13. Change Matrigel-medium mixture every 2 days.
14. Immunostaining and confocal microscopy observation of 3D cultures are recommended.

### 2. Embedded MDCK 3D culture

1. Thaw Matrigel matrix overnight by submerging the vial in ice in a 4°C refrigerator. Swirl to disperse.
2. On Day 0, dilute Matrigel matrix to 5 mg/mL with ice-cold complete MDCK medium (MEM + 10% FBS).
   - **Note:** Keep all cultureware and reagents contacting Matrigel on ice.
3. Using pre-chilled tips, coat pre-chilled 24-well plates by adding 100 μL of 5 mg/mL Matrigel to each well. Spread evenly.
4. Incubate at 37°C for 30 min to form gel.
   - **Note:** Avoid overdrying the Matrigel during gelation.
5. Trypsinize MDCK cells to single-cell suspension.
6. Pellet cells at 125 x g for 5 min at room temperature.
   - **Note:** Use healthy, <85% confluent cells. Pipet vigorously to disperse clumps.
7. Resuspend cells in complete medium; adjust concentration to 5 × 10^6 cells/mL.
8. Mix 30 μL of cell suspension with 270 μL of 5 mg/mL Matrigel matrix (on ice) for a final cell density of 5 x 10^5 cells/mL.
   - **Note:** Cell suspension volume should not exceed 10% of Matrigel volume for proper polymerization. Cell number may require optimization.
9. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 to 45 min to allow gelation.
10. Gently add 500 μL of MDCK complete medium to each well.
11. Culture for 8 to 10 days.
12. Change medium every 2 days.
13. Immunostaining and confocal microscopy observation of 3D cultures are recommended.

## Notes
- All cultureware/media contacting Matrigel must be pre-chilled.
- Avoid overdrying Matrigel during gel formation.
- Cell numbers may need optimization based on growth properties.
- MDCK cells tend to form clumps; pipetting vigorously is recommended to obtain single-cell suspension.

## Potential Missing Parameters (compare to source)

- CO2 concentration during incubation (likely 5% CO2) is not mentioned in the generated protocol but is a standard parameter and usually assumed [CHECK].
- The source mentions to avoid overdrying Matrigel during gel formation but no quantitative guidance is given—this is consistent, but no further clarification appears.
- The source protocol notes to keep medium thoroughly chilled before addition of Matrigel in the on-top method; the generated protocol mentions this but not the detailed rationale.
- The source mentions swirls the vial to "ensure material is dispersed" during thaw; generated protocol mentions swirl but omits the detail that the vial is submerged in ice specifically in the embedded protocol thaw step (they say "submerging the vial in ice in a 4°C refrigerator" vs "submerging the vial in a 4°C refrigerator").
- The source mentions use of "pre-chilled 24-well plates" in on-top protocol step 2, and also for embedded protocol step 3; generated protocol reflects this, no omission.
- The specific note "The volume of the cells should not be over 10% of the Matrigel solution" in embedded protocol step 5 is present.
- No explicit mention of CO2/O2 levels anywhere in the source PDF; generated protocol did not add.

## Possible Hallucinations / Unsupported Claims

- None detected.  
The generated protocol closely tracks the source text's instructions and notes without adding unsupported details.

---

## Step Order / Omission Risks

- None detected.  
The step order matches the source instructions as presented.  
All critical steps (thawing, spreading Matrigel, centrifugation, resuspension, plating, incubation times) are present and in the correct sequence.

# Summary

The generated protocol accurately reflects all critical numeric parameters and procedural details present in the source text and does not add any unsupported claims. It omits specification of CO2 environment, which is not detailed in the source text but important for cell culture [CHECK]. Other procedural notes and parameters are well transcribed. No major risks of omitted steps or reordering are apparent.
