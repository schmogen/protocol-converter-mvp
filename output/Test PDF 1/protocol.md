# Corning® Matrigel® Basement Membrane Matrix for 3D Culture In Vitro Protocol

## Objective
To culture MDCK cells in 3D using Corning Matrigel basement membrane matrix by two methods: on-top and embedded culture, allowing formation of 3D structures for further analysis such as immunostaining and confocal microscopy.

## Materials
- MDCK cell line (ATCC CCL-34, Canis familiaris kidney cell line)
- Corning Matrigel matrix (Corning Cat. No. 356234)
- MEM (Corning Cat. No. 10-009-CV)
- FBS (Corning Cat. No. 35-015-CV)
- PBS (Corning Cat. No. 21-040-CV)
- 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA (Corning Cat. No. 25-053-Cl)
- 24-well plate (Corning Cat. No. 3524)

## Procedure

### 1. On-top MDCK 3D Culture
1. Thaw Matrigel matrix overnight at 4°C by submerging the vial in a refrigerator. Swirl the vial after thawing to disperse the matrix.
2. Add 200 μL Matrigel matrix (8 to 11 mg/mL) to each well of a pre-chilled 24-well plate. Spread evenly with a pipet tip and incubate at 37°C for 30 min to allow gelling.
   - Note: Keep all cultureware and media on ice when contacting Matrigel. Do not overdry the Matrigel during gelation.
3. Wash MDCK cells once with PBS. Trypsinize cells to obtain a single-cell suspension.
4. Centrifuge cells at 125 x g for 5 min at room temperature (RT) to pellet.
   - Note: Use healthy cells less than 85% confluent. Pipet vigorously to break up clumps.
5. Resuspend cells in MDCK complete medium (MEM + 10% FBS) to 3 x 10^5 cells/mL. Plate 250 μL of this suspension into each Matrigel-coated well. Incubate at 37°C for 30 min.
   - Note: Cell number may require optimization.
6. Chill MDCK complete medium on ice. Add Matrigel matrix to 10% of final volume (final concentration 0.8 to 1.1 mg/mL).
7. Gently add 250 μL of the chilled Matrigel-medium mixture to each well by pipetting down the side to avoid disturbing cells or Matrigel.
8. Incubate cultures continuously for 4 to 7 days, changing the Matrigel-medium mixture every 2 days.
9. Immunostaining and confocal microscopy are recommended for observing 3D culture morphology.

### 2. Embedded MDCK 3D Culture
1. Thaw Matrigel matrix overnight at 4°C in ice. Swirl after thawing to disperse.
2. On Day 0, dilute Matrigel matrix to 5 mg/mL with ice-cold MDCK complete medium (MEM + 10% FBS).
   - Note: Keep all materials on ice when handling Matrigel.
3. Using pre-chilled tips, coat a pre-chilled 24-well plate by adding 100 μL of 5 mg/mL Matrigel per well. Spread evenly and incubate at 37°C for 30 min to gel.
   - Note: Avoid overdrying the Matrigel during gelation.
4. Trypsinize MDCK cells to a single-cell suspension. Centrifuge at 125 x g for 5 min at RT.
   - Note: Use healthy cells less than 85% confluent. Pipet vigorously to break up clumps.
5. Resuspend cells in complete medium and adjust density to 5 × 10^6 cells/mL.
6. Mix 30 μL cell suspension with 270 μL of 5 mg/mL Matrigel kept on ice to get final density 5 × 10^5 cells/mL.
   - Note: Cell volume should not exceed 10% of Matrigel volume to ensure proper polymerization. Optimize cell number as needed.
7. Add the cell-Matrigel mixture into each well and incubate at 37°C for 30 to 45 min to allow gelation.
8. Gently add 500 μL MDCK complete medium to each well.
9. Culture for 8 to 10 days, changing medium every 2 days.
10. Immunostaining and confocal microscopy analysis are recommended.

## Notes
- Always keep Matrigel matrix and cultureware cold (on ice) before gelation steps.
- Avoid overdrying Matrigel during gel polymerization.
- Use cells that are healthy and not more than 85% confluent.
- Some optimization of cell density may be required depending on cell growth properties.
- Pipetting vigorously helps obtain a single-cell suspension from MDCK cells to prevent clumps.

## Potential Missing Parameters (compare to source)

- CO2 concentration during incubation (commonly 5% but missing in protocol)  
- Exact RPM for centrifugation is missing; only RCF is provided (125 x g)  
- Details on O2 levels during culture are not mentioned (not specified in source, so acceptable)  
- Temperature stated as "room temperature" for centrifugation—no exact numeric range (acceptable but [CHECK] if RT varies in lab)  
- No explicit mention whether medium changes involve removal of old overlay medium or complete replacement (source does not clarify)  
- No details on temperature/humidity/CO2 conditions during 4-7 or 8-10 day culture periods (source only states 37°C)  
- No instructions or specifics about the immunostaining procedure (only recommended; omission probably acceptable here)  

## Possible Unsupported Claims

- None detected. All protocol steps, parameters, and notes are supported by source text.  
- The protocol’s objective and recommended immunostaining/confocal microscopy are consistent with source text.  

## Step Order / Omission Risks

- None detected. Step order aligns well with source text for both on-top and embedded methods.  
- The note about "pipet vigorously to obtain single-cell suspensions" occurs at consistent steps.  
- The caution to avoid overdrying Matrigel during gelation is included at appropriate points.  
- All recommended medium changes every 2 days during culture are retained in correct order.  
- No steps appear skipped or reordered relative to source text.  

---

Summary: The generated protocol is a faithful and safe extraction of the source method with key numeric parameters retained. Minor omissions on incubation atmosphere details and centrifuge RPM may warrant flagging depending on experimental rigor requirements, but no critical unsafe omissions or unsupported claims are present.
