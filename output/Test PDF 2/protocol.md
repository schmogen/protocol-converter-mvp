## Protocols

### 3.A. Isolating HMW DNA from Whole Blood  

1. Add 900µl HMW Blood Lysis Buffer to a sterile 1.5ml ClickFit Microtube.  
   - Blood must be collected in EDTA, heparin, or citrate anticoagulant tubes.  
2. Gently mix blood tube and transfer 300µl blood to the lysis buffer tube. Invert 5–6 times.  
3. Incubate 10 minutes at room temperature, invert 2–3 times during incubation for red blood cell lysis.  
4. Centrifuge at 13,000–16,000 × g for 20 seconds at room temperature.  
5. Discard supernatant carefully without disturbing the white cell pellet; leave ~10–20µl residual liquid.  
6. If sample is frozen, repeat Steps 1–4 until pellet is white; DNA loss may occur.  
   - If pellet is bright red, add more HMW Blood Lysis Buffer and repeat Steps 3–4.  
7. Add 100µl PBS and vortex vigorously for 10–15 seconds to resuspend white blood cells.  
   - When pooling tubes, combine suspensions sequentially, vortexing each.  
8. Add 500µl HMW Lysis Buffer A, mix 5 times using 1,000µl wide-bore pipette tips (slowly aspirate, quickly dispense to side).  
   - Do not pipet more than 5 times to avoid DNA shearing.  
   - If wide-bore tips unavailable, use standard tips with gentle aspiration and dispensing.  
   - If clumps persist, incubate at 37°C until dissolved.  
9. Add 3.0µl RNase A Solution, invert 5–7 times, incubate 37°C for 15 minutes.  
10. Add 20µl Proteinase K Solution, invert 10 times, incubate 56°C for 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature ≥5 minutes or on ice 1 minute.  
11. Add 200µl Protein Precipitation Solution, mix 5 times using 1,000µl wide-bore tips (slow aspirate, quick dispense).  
    - Do not pipet more than 5 times.  
    - If wide-bore tips unavailable, vortex 5 seconds instead.  
12. Centrifuge 13,000–16,000 × g for 5 minutes at room temperature to pellet protein. Repeat if debris remains.  
13. Transfer supernatant to tube containing 600µl room temperature isopropanol by decanting; leave residual liquid with pellet.  
14. Gently invert tube 8 times to mix. Incubate 1 minute at room temperature, invert again. DNA strands may be visible.  
15. Centrifuge 13,000–16,000 × g for 2 minutes at room temperature to pellet DNA.  
16. Decant supernatant and add 600µl room temperature 70% ethanol. Gently invert several times to wash pellet and tube walls.  
17. Centrifuge as in Step 15.  
18. Aspirate ethanol carefully without disturbing loose DNA pellet. Air-dry pellet 10–15 minutes on clean absorbent paper with tube inverted.  
19. Add 100µl DNA Rehydration Solution. Do not vortex.  
    - Rehydrate overnight at room temperature OR  
    - Incubate 65°C for 1 hour, gently tapping periodically.  
20. If undissolved pellet remains, mix gently with 200µl wide-bore pipette tips.

## Notes  
- Use wide-bore pipette tips to minimize mechanical shearing of HMW DNA during mixing steps.  
- Avoid vigorous vortexing of DNA samples after rehydration; use 200µl wide-bore tips for gentle mixing if needed.  
- Yield and DNA size may be affected by sample handling; careful adherence to protocol is essential for optimal results.  
- Frozen blood samples may yield lower DNA amounts and require repeat lysis steps.  
- For biohazard handling of blood, follow institutional safety guidelines.  
- If no protein pellet forms or other issues arise, consult troubleshooting section or Promega technical support.

---

## Troubleshooting highlights  
- Clotted blood: Use proper anticoagulant tubes and fresh blood.  
- Poor DNA yield: Insufficient white blood cells; old blood samples; incomplete resuspension.  
- RNA contamination: Use DNA-specific fluorometric assays; limit bacterial culture growth time.  
- Poor protein precipitation: Avoid exceeding recommended sample input; ensure thorough mixing and proper cooling.  
- DNA pellet difficult to dissolve: Avoid overdrying; rehydrate at 65°C for 1 hour, then overnight at room temperature.  
- Always handle DNA gently to preserve high molecular weight.
