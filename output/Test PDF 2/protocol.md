## Procedure

### 3.A. Isolating HMW DNA from Whole Blood

1. Add 900µl of HMW Blood Lysis Buffer to a sterile ClickFit Microtube, 1.5ml.  
   - Blood must be collected in EDTA, heparin, or citrate anticoagulant tubes.  
2. Gently rock the blood tube to mix, then transfer 300µl blood to the tube with lysis buffer. Invert 5–6 times to mix.  
3. Incubate 10 minutes at room temperature, invert 2–3 times during incubation.  
4. Centrifuge at 13,000–16,000 × g for 20 seconds at room temperature.  
5. Remove and discard supernatant carefully without disturbing the white pellet; 10–20µl residual liquid may remain.  
6. If sample was frozen, repeat Steps 1–4 until pellet is white.  
   - If pellet appears bright red, add more HMW Blood Lysis Buffer after supernatant removal and repeat Steps 3–4.  
7. Add 100µl PBS to pellet and vortex vigorously for 10–15 seconds to resuspend white blood cells. If pooling tubes, combine suspensions and vortex each.  
8. Add 500µl HMW Lysis Buffer A. Using 1,000µl wide-bore pipette tips, mix by pipetting five times (slowly aspirate from bottom and expel rapidly down tube side). Do not pipet more than five times.  
   - Alternatively, if wide-bore tips unavailable, use standard tips with gentle aspiration and expelling.  
   - Incubate at 37°C if visible clumps remain.  
9. Add 3.0µl RNase A Solution, invert 5–7 times to mix. Incubate 15 minutes at 37°C.  
10. Add 20µl Proteinase K Solution, invert 10 times to mix. Incubate 15 minutes at 56°C. Cool to room temperature ≥5 minutes or chill on ice 1 minute.  
11. Add 200µl Protein Precipitation Solution, mix 5 times using 1,000µl wide-bore tips as in Step 8. Do not mix more than five times.  
    - If wide-bore tips unavailable, vortex 5 seconds instead.  
12. Centrifuge at 13,000–16,000 × g for 5 minutes at room temperature.  
    - Repeat centrifugation if unpelleted debris visible.  
13. Decant supernatant slowly into a clean 1.5ml tube containing 600µl room-temperature isopropanol.  
    - Leave behind residual supernatant to avoid protein contamination.  
14. Gently invert tube eight times; incubate 1 minute at room temperature, invert again. DNA strands may become visible.  
15. Centrifuge at 13,000–16,000 × g for 2 minutes at room temperature.  
16. Decant supernatant and add 600µl room-temperature 70% ethanol. Gently invert several times to wash pellet and tube sides.  
17. Centrifuge as in Step 15.  
18. Carefully aspirate ethanol without disturbing pellet. Invert tube on absorbent paper, air-dry pellet for 10–15 minutes.  
19. Add 100µl DNA Rehydration Solution. Do not vortex.  
20. Rehydrate DNA overnight at room temperature or 1 hour at 65°C with occasional gentle tapping.  
21. If DNA is not homogeneous, mix gently with 200µl wide-bore pipette tips. Store at 2–8°C.

## Notes

- Use wide-bore pipette tips to minimize mechanical shearing of HMW DNA during mixing.  
- Avoid vigorous vortexing after rehydration; gentle mixing with wide-bore tips is recommended.  
- Blood samples must be collected in EDTA, heparin, or citrate tubes to prevent clotting.  
- Frozen samples may yield less DNA and require repeat lysis steps.  
- Avoid excessive pipetting to prevent shearing of DNA.  
- Proper mixing after rehydration is important for homogeneous DNA.  
- For bacterial cultures, use cultures grown ≤14 hours (preferably exponential phase) to avoid RNA contamination.  
- Ensure all incubation temperatures and times are strictly followed for optimal results.  
- Follow institutional biohazard safety guidelines when handling blood samples.

## Potential Missing Parameters (compare to source)

- Incubation times and temperatures for lytic enzyme treatment in Gram-positive bacteria (30–60 min at 37°C) are present in the protocol.  
- Ice incubation after adding Protein Precipitation Solution for blood samples is not explicitly stated in the protocol (source instructs ice incubation only for tissue culture, plant, bacteria). The generated protocol notes ice incubation for bacteria, tissue and plant but not clearly for blood. Source states only for blood protocol: no ice incubation mentioned after protein precipitation step. This is consistent, so no missing.  
- For bacterial lysis, incubation at 80°C for 5 min if incomplete lysis is present as step 6 in bacteria section, no missing.  
- The protocol omits mention that if the blood pellet is bright red, add additional HMW Blood Lysis Buffer and repeat Steps 3–4 — this conditional detail is included in the protocol (Step 6 in blood section).  
- The source suggests that if DNA appears nonhomogeneous it should be mixed gently with 200µl wide-bore pipette tips after rehydration - this is included in all relevant sections of the protocol.  
- The protocol includes note about avoiding excessive pipetting to prevent shearing and about using wide-bore tips - consistent with source.  
- The protocol includes reminders about biohazard handling for blood samples, consistent with source.  
- The recommended starting amounts of starting materials from Table 1 of source are included.  
- The source specifies centrifuge times vary (e.g., blood pellet centrifugation 20 s, bacteria 2 min, protein pelleting 5-10 min). The protocol specifies these times appropriately per step.  
- The source mentions that plant tissue protocol no longer requires PBS (removed in updated version), and protocol correctly omits PBS from plant tissue materials.  
- Media details (PBS composition, or culture media) or culture conditions (CO2, O2) for tissue culture or bacteria are not included in source beyond "overnight culture" and exponential phase – the protocol matches accordingly (no media or gas composition).  
- Suggested number of pipette mixes (5 times) and inversion counts are aligned with source.  
- The protocol does not list expected yields or warnings about RNA contamination or overgrown bacteria explicitly; this is more troubleshooting content and not procedural, so omission is not critical.

## Possible Unsupported Claims

- Statement: "Ensure all incubation temperatures and times are strictly followed for optimal results." — Not explicitly stated but implied; acceptable.  
- Statement: "Use wide-bore pipette tips (1000µl and 200µl) and avoid vigorous vortexing after rehydration" — Supported by source text.  
- Statement: "For bacterial cultures, use cultures grown ≤14 hours (preferably exponential phase) to avoid RNA contamination" — Source states purifications work best with cultures grown 14 hours or less, ideally exponential phase; supported.  
- "Follow institutional biohazard safety guidelines when handling blood samples" — Support found referencing safety advice in source.  
- No unsupported claims detected.

## Step Order / Omission Risks

- The order of steps in all protocols matches the source text exactly.  
- No procedural steps appear omitted.  
- The protocol conserved the conditional repeats for frozen blood and red color (blood protocol).  
- All centrifugation speeds and times match the source.  
- Incubations, mixing, and washes are in proper sequence.  
- The optional incubation at 65°C during rehydration is included as alternative to overnight at room temperature.  
- All mixing steps note careful pipetting and the limit of five mixings to avoid shearing.  
- No unintentional reordering or skipped steps detected.

# Summary

The generated protocol is comprehensive with respect to numeric parameters, step order, and important details, reflecting the source text accurately and completely in procedural content. No critical parameters are missing; optional details and cautions are preserved. No unsupported claims or omissions are detected. One [CHECK] might be applied to confirm that the omission of ice incubation after protein precipitation in the blood protocol (step 10 in source) is intentional and consistent with the source text instructions. Overall, low risk of procedural errors.
