- 70% Ethanol or similar decontamination solution
- Gibco™ DMEM, high glucose, with NEAA, no glutamine, with phenol red (liquid)
- Gibco™ Penicillin-Streptomycin (10,000 U/mL penicillin + 10,000 μg/mL streptomycin, 100X stock)
- Gibco™ L-glutamine (200 mM, 100X stock)
- Gibco™ Fetal Bovine Serum (Certified, US origin, 10%)
- Gibco™ 1 M HEPES (pH 7.2)
- T-175 flasks
- Suitable sterile collection vessels (e.g., single-use bottle or carboy)

## Procedure

### Cell Thawing
1. Thaw 1 vial of MRC-5 cells in a 37°C water bath until minimal ice remains.
2. Decontaminate vial exterior with 70% ethanol or similar solution.
3. Transfer cell suspension to a 15 mL centrifuge tube containing 9 mL of recommended growth medium.
4. Gently triturate the cell suspension with a pipette.

### Passage 1: Seeding and Expansion in T-Flasks
1. Seed a T-175 flask containing 50 mL growth medium with 15,000 cells/cm².
2. Incubate for 7 days at 37°C under 5% CO₂ aeration.  
   - If CO₂ aeration is not available, add HEPES to the culture medium and incubate at 37°C.
3. Sample flask medium for glucose, lactate, pH, glutamate, and ammonium measurement.
4. Remove remaining medium.
5. Wash cells with 10 mL DPBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+.
6. Add 5 mL 0.25% trypsin-EDTA.
7. Incubate 2–3 minutes or until cell layer detachment is visually confirmed.
8. Inactivate trypsin-EDTA with 20 mL growth medium and collect cell suspension.
9. Gently triturate cell suspension.
10. Sample a small volume for cell counting.
11. Count cells (viable and nonviable).
12. Determine cell amount for seeding next vessel based on count.

### Passage 2: Cell Expansion in T-Flasks
1. Plate 6 x T-175 flasks at 15,000 cells/cm² using 50 mL growth medium each.
2. Incubate for 7 days at 37°C with 5% CO₂ aeration.  
   - If CO₂ aeration is not available, add HEPES to growth medium and incubate at 37°C.
3. Repeat steps 3–12 from Passage 1 for each flask.

### Passage 3–5: Cell Expansion in Cell Factory and High Density Cell Factory Systems

#### Preparation
- Cell Factory 2-layer system: DPBS volume 80 mL (40 mL per layer), Trypsin-EDTA volume 30 mL (15 mL per layer), Growth medium volume 80 mL (40 mL per layer)
- High Density Cell Factory 3-layer system: DPBS volume 120 mL (40 mL per layer), Trypsin-EDTA volume 45 mL (15 mL per layer), Growth medium volume 120 mL (40 mL per layer)

#### Procedure
1. Plate 2 x Cell Factory 2-layer system (control) and 2 x High Density Cell Factory 3-layer system at 15,000 cells/cm² using 200 mL growth medium per layer.
2. Incubate for 6 days at 37°C.
3. Sample each unit for glucose, lactate, pH, glutamate, and ammonium measurement.
4. Remove remaining medium.
5. Wash with DPBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (see volumes above).
6. Discard wash buffer.
7. Add 0.25% trypsin-EDTA per layer (see volumes above).
8. Incubate for 4–5 minutes or until detachment is visually confirmed.
9. Inactivate trypsin-EDTA with growth medium (see volumes above).
10. Collect cell suspension in sterile vessel.
11. Repeat trypsin-EDTA addition and inactivation to remove residual cells.
12. Collect and pool remaining cell suspension.
13. Agitate collection vessel gently to homogenize suspension.
14. Sample small volume from center for cell counting.
15. Count cells and record.
16. Determine cell amount needed for next vessel seeding.

### Passaging into High Density Cell Factory 13-layer Systems

#### Preparation
- Cell Factory 10-layer system: DPBS volume 400 mL (40 mL per layer), Trypsin-EDTA volume 150 mL (15 mL per layer), Growth medium volume 2 L (200 mL per layer)
- High Density Cell Factory 13-layer system: DPBS volume 520 mL (40 mL per layer), Trypsin-EDTA volume 195 mL (15 mL per layer), Growth medium volume 2.6 L (200 mL per layer)

#### Procedure
1. Plate 3 x Cell Factory 10-layer system (control) and 3 x High Density Cell Factory 13-layer system at 15,000 cells/cm² using 200 mL growth medium per layer.
2. Incubate for 6 days at 37°C.
3. Sample each unit for glucose, lactate, pH, glutamate, and ammonium measurement.
4. Remove remaining medium from cells.
5. Wash with DPBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (see volumes above).
6. Discard wash buffer.
7. Add 0.25% trypsin-EDTA per layer (see volumes above).
8. Incubate for 4–5 minutes or until detachment is visually verified.
9. Inactivate trypsin-EDTA with recommended growth medium (see volumes above).
10. Collect cell suspension in sterile vessel.
11. Repeat trypsin-EDTA addition and inactivation to ensure complete cell removal.
12. Collect and pool remaining cell suspension.
13. Count cells and record.

## Notes
- Agitate collection vessels gently to ensure homogeneous cell suspensions during pooling.
- If CO₂ aeration is unavailable, supplement culture medium with 5–10 mM HEPES and incubate at 37°C.
- Verify cell detachment visually before trypsin inactivation.
- Use appropriate sterile collection vessels for large volume handling.
