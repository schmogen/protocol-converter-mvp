## Potential Missing Parameters (compare to source)
- Exact cell count volumes during thaw step (transfer to 15 mL tube with 9 mL medium) included but centrifugation step is missing (source mentions centrifuge tubes, but no spin described—[CHECK])  
- Mechanical details of pipette triturating (speed or force) not detailed in protocol (source just says "gently triturate," which is included)  
- No centrifugation settings (RCF, time, temperature) mentioned in source or protocol (source silent, but reviewer noted)  
- Harvesting steps mention "discard used wash buffer" and "collect and pool cells" which are included but steps for gentle swirling or rotation for homogenization are only lightly noted; no rpm or detailed mixing parameters (source states "gentle swirling or rotation" only)  
- Sampling volumes for metabolite measurements not specified in generated protocol (source just says "take a sample"); no sampling frequency or volume details given—might be ambiguous, but consistent with source  
- Passage 2 plating protocol states "Plated with 50 mL growth medium per T-175 flask"; volumes for passages 3–5 plating expansions are given but the generated protocol flags expansion medium volumes for 10-layer and 13-layer systems as [CHECK] due to lack of explicit source detail—source has some corresponding volumes but unclear if expansion differs from plating volume for these 

## Possible Unsupported Claims
- Growth medium volume per system for expansion in 10-layer and 13-layer systems marked as [CHECK] due to no explicit numbers in the source text (the source presents plating volumes clearly but is less explicit for expansion medium volumes per system beyond plating)  
- Protocol states "Repeat steps 3–12 from Passage 1" during Passage 2 expansion in T-flasks, which is supported by source but the source steps 3-12 include sampling and counting steps rather than intermediate washing before expansion—this is consistent but complex—no clear contradiction  
- The protocol notes "mix by gentle swirling or rotation" for suspensions with no rpm or duration; source text matches but no rpm/time given, so acceptable but no quantitative mixing parameter—correctly flagged as [CHECK] in the protocol

## Step Order / Omission Risks
- No centrifugation step after thawing cells stated in source or protocol; if intended or required is unclear—may be an omission or protocol simplification  
- Passage 1 step "4. Gently triturate the suspension" comes before the transfer to flask seeding step in protocol, consistent with source  
- The protocol omits explicit mention of "discarding wash buffer" step in Passage 1 (step 6 in source), but implied in phrase "discard wash buffer" during later passages—may require explicit restatement in Passage 1 for clarity  
- The protocol captures all sequential steps as per source; no major reordering detected  
- Cell counting and sampling steps at multiple passages included and consistent  
- Washing volumes and trypsinization volumes per system carefully matched with source; no missing wash steps detected  
- No mention in the protocol about pH adjustments of HEPES stock solution except noting pH 7.2 omission [appropriate flag]  
- No centrifugation conditions specified, risk if trypsin inactivation requires centrifugation (source silent but absence should be noted)  
- Growth medium volume for expansion in large scale 10-layer and 13-layer systems is flagged as [CHECK] indicating possible partial omission/ambiguity

---

Summary: The generated protocol matches source parameters closely in volumes, times, and concentrations, except for missing centrifugation (unclear if intended), and some ambiguity in expansion medium volumes for large-layer systems. No unsupported claims identified, but a few [CHECK] flags for parameters not fully detailed in source. No critical step omissions or reorderings detected.
