APPLICATION PROTOCOL Cell Factory systems
P rotocol for MRC-5 cultivation
Nunc High Density Cell Factory systems
Introduction
This protocol was developed to validate the performance
of Thermo Scientific™ Nunc™ High Density Cell Factory™
systems for the culturing of MRC-5 cells. The protocol
includes the recommended use of standard Nunc Cell
Factory systems as controls. This protocol may be used
as a reference or as a resource for options to optimize the
performance of established protocols.
