# Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent Protocol

## Objective
To transfect eukaryotic cells with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent for efficient nucleic acid delivery, including optimization of reagent amount.

## Materials
- Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent  
- P3000™ Reagent  
- Plasmid DNA (0.5–5 μg/μL stock)  
- Opti-MEM™ Reduced Serum Medium  
- Microcentrifuge tubes  
- Cells plated to 70–90% confluency (adherent cells)  
- Cell culture medium  

## Procedure

### Day 0: Cell Seeding
1. Plate cells to reach 70–90% confluency at transfection time.
   - 96-well plate: 1–4 × 10^4 cells/well  
   - 24-well plate: 0.5–2 × 10^5 cells/well  
   - 6-well plate: 0.25–1 × 10^6 cells/well  

### Day 1: Prepare DNA-Lipofectamine Complexes (Two Reaction Optimization)
2. Prepare two dilutions of Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent in Opti-MEM™ Medium.  
   - 96-well: 0.15 µL and 0.3 µL Lipofectamine™ 3000 in 5 µL Opti-MEM™ (2 tubes)  
   - 24-well: 0.75 µL and 1.5 µL Lipofectamine™ 3000 in 25 µL Opti-MEM™ (2 tubes)  
   - 6-well: 3.75 µL and 7.5 µL Lipofectamine™ 3000 in 125 µL Opti-MEM™ (2 tubes)  
   - Mix well and vortex 2–3 seconds.  

3. Prepare diluted DNA solution in Opti-MEM™ Medium and add P3000™ Reagent (2 µL per µg of DNA).  
   - Total DNA per well: 100 ng (96-well), 500 ng (24-well), 2500 ng (6-well)  
   - P3000™ Reagent: 0.2 µL (96-well), 1 µL (24-well), 5 µL (6-well)  
   - DNA volume added to Lipofectamine™ 3000 tubes:  
     - 96-well: 5 µL  
     - 24-well: 25 µL  
     - 6-well: 125 µL  

4. Add diluted DNA + P3000™ Reagent to each tube of diluted Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent (1:1 ratio).  
   - Lipofectamine™ 3000 volume per reaction is equal to DNA volume (see above).  

5. Incubate the DNA-lipid complexes for 10–15 minutes at room temperature.

### Transfection
6. Add the complete DNA-lipid complexes to the plated cells directly in culture medium (serum and antibiotics can be present).  
   - Total DNA-lipid complex volume per well:  
     - 96-well: 10 µL  
     - 24-well: 50 µL  
     - 6-well: 250 µL  
   - Corresponding reagent amounts will be as prepared above.

### Post-Transfection
7. Incubate transfected cells for 2–4 days at 37°C.  

8. Analyze or visualize transfected cells as required.

## Additional Notes
- It is not necessary to remove complexes or change culture medium after transfection.  
- For siRNA transfection, follow this protocol but do **not** add P3000™ Reagent when diluting siRNA.  
- Store Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent at 4°C; do not freeze.  
- Optimize Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent amount by testing two concentrations as described.  
- Use serum-free medium (such as Opti-MEM™) for DNA-lipid complex preparation only.  
- Scaling of reagent volumes should be proportional for multiple wells.
