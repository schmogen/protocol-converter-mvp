# Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent Transfection Protocol

## Objective
To transfect eukaryotic cells using Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent with optimized DNA-lipid complex formation, enabling efficient nucleic acid delivery without the need to change medium after transfection.

## Materials
- Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent  
- P3000™ Reagent  
- Plasmid DNA (0.5–5 μg/μL stock)  
- Opti-MEM™ Reduced Serum Medium  
- Microcentrifuge tubes  
- Cells seeded to 70–90% confluence (adherent cells)  
- Pipettes and sterile pipette tips  

## Procedure

### Day 0: Seed Cells
1. Plate cells to reach 70–90% confluence at the time of transfection.
   - 96-well: 1–4 × 10^4 cells/well  
   - 24-well: 0.5–2 × 10^5 cells/well  
   - 6-well: 0.25–1 × 10^6 cells/well  

### Day 1: Prepare DNA-Lipid Complexes and Transfect

2. Prepare diluted Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent in Opti-MEM™ Medium in two tubes for optimization:
   - 96-well: 0.15 µL and 0.3 µL Lipofectamine™ 3000 in 5 µL Opti-MEM each  
   - 24-well: 0.75 µL and 1.5 µL Lipofectamine™ 3000 in 25 µL Opti-MEM each  
   - 6-well: 3.75 µL and 7.5 µL Lipofectamine™ 3000 in 125 µL Opti-MEM each  
   - Mix well and vortex 2–3 seconds  

3. Prepare diluted DNA solutions in Opti-MEM™ Medium:  
   - 96-well: 0.2 µg DNA in 5 µL Opti-MEM  
   - 24-well: 1 µg DNA in 25 µL Opti-MEM  
   - 6-well: 5 µg DNA in 125 µL Opti-MEM  

4. Add P3000™ Reagent to diluted DNA at 2 µL per µg DNA:  
   - 96-well: 0.4 µL P3000™  
   - 24-well: 2 µL P3000™  
   - 6-well: 10 µL P3000™  
   - Mix well  

5. Add diluted DNA (with P3000™ Reagent) dropwise to each tube of diluted Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent (1:1 ratio):  
   - 96-well: 5 µL DNA mix + 5 µL Lipofectamine mix  
   - 24-well: 25 µL DNA mix + 25 µL Lipofectamine mix  
   - 6-well: 125 µL DNA mix + 125 µL Lipofectamine mix  

6. Incubate DNA-lipid complexes for 10–15 minutes at room temperature.

7. Add the DNA-lipid complex mixture dropwise to cells containing culture medium (serum and antibiotics can be present).  
   Volumes per well:  
   - 96-well: 10 µL total complex containing 100 ng DNA, 0.2 µL P3000™, and 0.15 and 0.3 µL Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent  
   - 24-well: 50 µL total complex containing 500 ng DNA, 1 µL P3000™, and 0.75 and 1.5 µL Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent  
   - 6-well: 250 µL total complex containing 2500 ng DNA, 5 µL P3000™, and 3.75 and 7.5 µL Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent  

### Day 2–4: Post-transfection  
8. Incubate cells for 2–4 days at 37°C.  
9. Visualize or analyze transfected cells as required.

## Notes
- DNA-Lipofectamine™ 3000 complexes must be prepared in serum-free medium such as Opti-MEM™.  
- It is not necessary to remove complexes or change/add medium after transfection.  
- For siRNA transfection, omit P3000™ Reagent when diluting siRNA.  
- Optimize Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent amount by testing two recommended concentrations to determine the optimum for your cell type.

- No medium change after transfection  

## Potential Missing Parameters (compare to source)

- Temperature of cell incubation post-transfection is specified as 37°C in the generated protocol but CO2 or O2 concentrations are not mentioned explicitly. Source implies standard culture conditions but does not specify CO2/O2; generated protocol did not specify either explicitly for incubation step.  
- The source emphasizes serum-free medium for complex formation (Opti-MEM™), which is retained. Presence or absence of serum/antibiotic during complex addition is mentioned briefly but the exact culture medium composition during transfection is not detailed (e.g., whether antibiotics are included), though the source states presence or absence is permissible.  
- Vortex mixing of Lipofectamine™ 3000 dilutions (2–3 s) is included in generated protocol, matching source.  
- The source mentions microcentrifuge tubes per well volumes but does not specify in protocol steps; generated protocol does not mention tubes explicitly.  
- The generated protocol omits explicit statement to "mix well" after adding P3000™ Reagent to DNA, although "Mix well" is included. No mention of vortex or specific rpm for mixing beyond mixing well or vortex 2–3 seconds for Lipofectamine.  
- The source mentions preparing complexes in two tubes for optimization testing; the generated protocol states the same.  
- The generated protocol includes step order and volumes consistent with source.  
- The source includes instructions for siRNA transfection omission of P3000™ Reagent; this is included in generated protocol.  

## Possible Unsupported Claims

- None detected.  
- All claims in the generated protocol are reflected clearly in the source text.  

## Step Order / Omission Risks

- None detected.  
- The generated protocol maintains the step order exactly as in the source.  
- All key steps from seeding through post-transfection incubation are present.  
- Steps related to reagent dilution, mixing, incubation, and addition to cells are maintained as per source.  
- The note on no need for medium change is present, consistent with source.  

---

Summary: The generated protocol accurately captures the critical numeric parameters, procedural steps, and conditions detailed in the source. Minor details such as medium composition during transfection and culture conditions (CO2/O2) are not explicitly defined but are consistent with typical cell culture practices implied by the source. No unsupported claims or major omissions were found.
