## Procedure

### 1. Preparation of mTeSR™3D Media

#### 1.1 Prepare mTeSR™3D Seed Medium (Example for 500 mL)
1. Thaw mTeSR™3D Seed 5X Supplement at room temperature (15 - 25°C) or overnight at 2 - 8°C. Mix thoroughly; do not thaw in 37°C water bath.
2. Add 100 mL of 5X Supplement to 400 mL of Seed Basal Medium. Mix thoroughly.
3. Store at 2 - 8°C up to 2 weeks or aliquot and freeze at -20°C for up to 6 months. Do not re-freeze thawed aliquots.
4. Immediately before use, add 10 µM Y-27632.

#### 1.2 Prepare mTeSR™3D Feed Medium (Example for 112 mL)
1. Thaw Feed Supplement A at room temperature (15 - 25°C) or overnight at 2 - 8°C. Mix thoroughly; do not thaw in 37°C water bath.
2. Add 12 mL of Feed Supplement B to 100 mL of Feed Supplement A. Mix thoroughly.
3. Store at 2 - 8°C for up to 2 weeks or aliquot and freeze at -20°C for up to 3 months. Do not re-freeze thawed aliquots.
4. Medium can be filtered through a 0.2 µm low-protein binding filter if desired before use.

### 2. Preparing Suspension Culture Vessels
- Refer to Appendix 1 for coating instructions.
- Polycarbonate vessels may be coated with Anti-Adherence Rinsing Solution.
- Glass spinner flasks should be cleaned with 0.1 M NaOH and coated with Sigmacote® as specified.

### 3. Initiating hPSC Suspension Culture in mTeSR™3D

#### 3.1 Use High-Quality 2D hPSC Cultures
- hPSCs should be maintained in 2D on Corning® Matrigel® in mTeSR™1 and passaged as clumps 50-100 µm in diameter.
- Cultures should have >95% expression of undifferentiated markers OCT4, TRA-1-60, SSEA-3.

#### 3.2 Dissociating 2D Culture to Small Clumps (from one 6-well plate well)

1. Prepare mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632 and warm to room temperature (15 - 25°C).
2. Mark and remove differentiated regions by scraping or aspiration.
3. Aspirate spent medium. Add 1 mL D-PBS (Without Ca++ and Mg++) at room temperature; then aspirate.
4. Add 1 mL GCDR at room temperature; incubate 6-8 minutes at room temperature.
5. Aspirate GCDR; add 1 mL mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632.
6. Gently detach colonies by scraping with a glass pipette or cell scraper without over-disrupting clump size.
7. Transfer clumps to 15 mL tube; optionally rinse well with 1 mL medium to collect remaining clumps.
8. Pipette up and down to achieve uniform aggregates about 50-100 µm in diameter (do not create single-cell suspension).
9. Count clumps (see Appendix 2) and calculate seeding volume.
10. Add concentrated clumps to culture vessel containing mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632; bring to desired total volume.

#### 3.3 Choosing Seeding Density
- Typical seeding densities: 1–5 x 10^5 viable cells/mL (roughly 1–5 x 10^3 clumps/mL).
- Final density should not exceed 1–2 x 10^6 viable cells/mL at passage end.
- Optimize seeding density per cell line, using small-scale system such as 6-well plates.

### 4. Culturing hPSC Suspension Aggregates

#### 4.1 Daily Fed-Batch Medium Addition

1. Prepare mTeSR™3D Feed Medium (see section 1.2).
2. Add 0.112 mL feed medium per mL of initial culture volume daily without removing spent medium.
3. Mix Feed Medium by pipetting; add to center of culture vessel.
4. Recommended daily feed volume examples:

| Vessel | Seed Medium Volume (mL) | Daily Feed Medium Volume (mL) |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 6-well plate (non-treated) | 2 | 0.224 |
| Corning 125 mL polycarbonate flask | 20 | 2.24 |
| Qorpak 300 mL polycarbonate bottle | 24 | 2.7 |
| INTEGRA CELLSPIN 100 mL glass spinner flask | 50 | 5.6 |
| INTEGRA CELLSPIN 250 mL glass spinner flask | 100 | 11.2 |
| Applikon MiniBio 500 bioreactor | 200 | 22.4 |

5. Use alternating 3-day/4-day passaging schedule for best results.

#### 4.2 Monitoring Aggregate Morphology
- Undifferentiated hPSC aggregates are spherical with shallow cratering and diameters 200–300 µm.
- Aggregate diameter should not exceed 400 µm to avoid nutrient limitation.
- Signs of differentiation or unhealthy aggregates include: smooth spherical appearance, translucent areas, excessive size (>400 µm), or very dark aggregates.
- Monitor morphology regularly for quality control.

### 5. Passaging Suspension Culture hPSCs

#### 5.1 Passaging Schedule
- Passage every 3–4 days to prevent aggregates exceeding 400 µm.

#### 5.2 Passaging Method (to Small Clumps)

1. Warm GCDR to 37°C and bring mTeSR™3D Seed Medium to room temperature.
2. Pre-filter culture through a 37 µm Reversible Strainer to remove single cells.
3. Rinse aggregates off strainer into fresh tube, saving extra strainer for dissociation.
4. Incubate aggregates in GCDR at 37°C for 6 minutes.
5. Carefully aspirate GCDR leaving ~0.5 mL.
6. Add mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632 to resuspend aggregates.
7. Using pipette, slowly push suspensions through 37 µm Reversible Strainer to generate small clumps (50–100 µm).
8. Optionally rinse strainer with 1–5 mL seed medium to increase yield.
9. Count clumps and seed into fresh mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632 at desired density.
10. Avoid leaving clump suspensions undisturbed >15 minutes to prevent aggregation.
11. Triturate gently before seeding if very large clumps (>400–500 µm) are present.

### 6. Troubleshooting
- Aggregates not forming: increase seeding density, decrease rpm, increase clump size, ensure Y-27632 in Seed Medium.
- Small aggregates at day 4: increase seeding density, decrease rpm, lengthen early passages.
- Large conglomerates: use high-quality 2D culture, decrease seeding density, reduce shear force.
- Excess single cells: ensure 2D culture quality, remove single cells on day 1 using strainers.
- Aggregates too large: decrease seeding density, passage more frequently, use smaller clump sizes.
- Difficulty dissociating aggregates: adjust dissociation time, shear force.
- Medium very yellow: shorten passage length, lower seeding density.
- Cells sticking to vessel: coat vessels, decrease seeding density, decrease rpm.
- Dense/dark aggregates: improve culture quality, passage sooner, lower seeding density.
- Irregular or non-uniform aggregates: ensure culture quality, start with consistent clumps, optimize rpm and seeding.

### 7. Appendix Summary

#### 7.1 Preparing Suspension Culture Vessels
- Polycarbonate vessels: coat with Anti-Adherence Rinsing Solution; incubate 15 min at 37°C shaking; rinse 3x with DMEM/F-12.
- Glass spinner flasks: clean with warm distilled water; soak in 0.1 M NaOH 30–60 min; rinse; treat with Sigmacote®; air dry overnight; autoclave; rinse 3x with DMEM/F-12.

#### 7.2 Counting Clumps (Appendix 2)
- Manual counting: dilute clumps in DMEM/F-12, count clumps ≥ 50 µm using inverted microscope; calculate concentration.
- Viable nuclei counting: use image-based counter with viability stain.

#### 7.3 Differentiating Suspension Cultures (Appendix 3)
- Use STEMdiff™ Trilineage Differentiation Kit (Catalog #05230) following generation of single-cell suspension.

#### 7.4 Re-Establishing 2D Cultures (Appendix 4)
- For clump-passaged cultures, plate 200–300 clumps/well on Matrigel-coated 6-well plates in 2 mL mTeSR™1 + 10 µM Y-27632.
- For single-cell passaged cultures, plate 4 x 10^5 cells/well in mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632; passage as clumps before switching to 2D.

#### 7.5 Dissociating Aggregates to Single Cells for Flow Cytometry (Appendix 6)
- Filter culture through 37 µm strainer.
- Incubate aggregates with enzymatic reagent at 37°C, pipette to single cells.
- Centrifuge, resuspend for downstream applications.

#### 7.6 Flow Cytometry Protocols (Appendix 7)
- Surface antigen labeling: incubate cells with primary or conjugated antibodies; wash; incubate with secondary antibody if needed; analyze.
- Intracellular antigen labeling (OCT4): fix cells in 2% paraformaldehyde; permeabilize with saponin buffer; stain with antibodies; analyze.

## Notes
- Use sterile techniques throughout.
- Do not thaw supplements in 37°C water baths.
- Add Y-27632 freshly to Seed Medium before use.
- Always handle cultures to avoid exposure to suboptimal temperatures or times outside incubator.
- Regularly monitor hPSC cultures for karyotype abnormalities every 10 passages.
- Optimize and adjust parameters based on cell line-specific growth and morphology.
- Avoid mechanical stress that could decrease viability or select for aberrant subpopulations.
