### 3. Initiating hPSC Suspension Culture in mTeSR™3D

#### 3.1 Starting with High-Quality 2D hPSC Cultures
- Use hPSCs cultured adherently on Corning® Matrigel® with mTeSR™1.  
- Confirm expression of pluripotency markers (OCT4, TRA-1-60, SSEA-3) > 95%.  
- Use cultures with normal morphology, growth rates, and karyotype.

#### 3.2 Dissociating 2D Culture to Small Clumps for 3D Seeding
1. Prepare mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632 and warm to room temperature (15 - 25°C). Do not warm in 37°C water bath.  
2. Inspect 2D culture; mark and remove differentiated areas by scraping or aspiration. Avoid > 15 minutes outside incubator.  
3. Aspirate spent medium; wash once with 1 mL D-PBS (without Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺) at room temperature.  
4. Aspirate D-PBS and add 1 mL Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (GCDR) at room temperature.  
5. Incubate 6 - 8 minutes at room temperature.  
6. Aspirate GCDR and add 1 mL mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632. Detach colonies by gentle scraping with a pipette or cell scraper without over-disrupting (clumps ~50 - 100 µm optimal).  
7. Transfer clumps into 15 mL conical tube. Optional: rinse well with 1 mL medium to collect remaining clumps.  
8. Gently pipette up and down to homogenize suspension; avoid single cells.  
9. Count clumps manually or with an automated cell counting instrument (see Appendix 2).  
10. Seed desired number of viable cells or clumps into suspension culture vessel, topping up to volume with mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632.

#### 3.3 Choosing Optimal Seeding Density
- Typical seeding density: 1 - 5 x 10⁵ viable cells/mL (approx. 1 - 5 x 10³ clumps/mL).  
- Final harvested density should not exceed 1 - 2 x 10⁶ viable cells/mL.  
- Cells may require adaptation; seed higher initially if needed, then reduce density.  
- Optimize density per cell line and culture conditions using small-scale vessels.  

Optimal Seeding Densities for Selected Cell Lines:

| Cell Line     | Viable Cells/mL | Clumps/mL   |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| H1 ES         | 1 x 10⁵         | 1 x 10³     |
| H7 ES         | 2 x 10⁵         | 2 x 10³     |
| H9 ES         | 5 x 10⁵         | 5 x 10³     |
| WLS-1C iPS    | 3 x 10⁵         | 3 x 10³     |
| STiPS M001*   | 1 x 10⁵         | 1 x 10³     |
| STiPS F016*   | 2 x 10⁵         | 2 x 10³     |

*In-house derived iPS cell lines.

### 4. Culturing hPSC Suspension Aggregates

#### 4.1 Fed-Batch Feeding
1. Prepare mTeSR™3D Feed Medium (section 1.2).  
2. Add daily feed volume equal to approximately 0.112 mL of Feed Medium per mL of Seed Medium in culture (see Table 4).  
3. Mix feed medium gently and add to the center of the culture without removing existing medium. Use fresh pipettes for each culture.  
4. Alternate 3-day/4-day passaging schedule recommended with feeding on non-passaging days.

| Culture Vessel                     | Seed Medium (mL) | Daily Feed Medium (mL) |
|----------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| 6-Well Flat-Bottom Plate          | 2                | 0.224                 |
| Corning® 125 mL Erlenmeyer Flask | 20               | 2.24                  |
| Qorpak® 300 mL Polycarbonate      | 24               | 2.7                   |
| INTEGRA CELLSPIN 100 mL Spinner   | 50               | 5.6                   |
| INTEGRA CELLSPIN 250 mL Spinner   | 100              | 11.2                  |
| Applikon MiniBio 500 Bioreactor   | 200              | 22.4                  |

#### 4.2 Monitoring Aggregate Morphology
- Undifferentiated aggregates: spherical, 200 - 300 µm diameter, with surface cratering; should not exceed 400 µm.  
- Avoid large bulbs, fully translucent areas, smooth spherical surfaces, or overly dark aggregates.  
- Changes in morphology may indicate differentiation, nutrient limitation, or cell death.  
- Observe morphology regularly via microscopy.

### 5. Passaging Suspension Culture hPSCs

#### 5.1 Passaging Schedule
- Alternate passage every 3 or 4 days to avoid aggregates > 400 µm.  
- Proper timing avoids passaging on weekends.

#### 5.2 Dissociation to Small Clumps Protocol (for ~20 mL culture, scale accordingly)

1. Aliquot 5 mL Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (GCDR) and warm to 37°C.  
2. Bring mTeSR™3D Seed Medium to room temperature (15 - 25°C).  
3. Prepare mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632 for resuspension—see Table 5 for volumes.  

| Initial Culture Volume (mL) | Day 4 Culture Volume (mL) | GCDR Volume (mL) | Resuspension Medium (mL) |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| 2                          | 2.7                       | 1                | 1                        |
| 20                         | 26.7                      | 5                | 5                        |
| 50                         | 66.8                      | 15               | 15                       |
| 100                        | 133.6                     | 30               | 30                       |

4. Image cultures before passaging to assess aggregate size.  
5. Pass culture through 37 µm Reversible Strainer to remove single cells into conical tube.  
   - Use small strainer and 15 mL tube for 6-well plates.  
6. Flip strainer onto new conical tube; rinse with 5 mL warm GCDR and tap to collect aggregates.  
7. Flip strainer onto second conical tube for use in step 13; keep aggregate-contact side up.  
8. Incubate aggregates in GCDR at 37°C for 6 minutes undisturbed.  
9. Remove tube gently; for volumes > 5 mL GCDR, centrifuge 2 minutes at 100 x g.  
10. Slowly aspirate GCDR, leaving ~0.5 mL to avoid losing aggregates.  
11. Add 5 mL mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632; resuspend gently.  
    - For >5-fold culture expansion, consider doubling resuspension volume.  
12. Using a 25 mL pipette, remove suspension carefully, avoiding bubbles.  
13. Pass suspension slowly through the 37 µm Reversible Strainer (flow rate ~0.5 mL/second) into new tube to generate small clumps (~50-100 µm).  
    - Scale pipetting per Table 6 below.  
14. Optionally rinse original tube with 5 mL mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632 and pass through strainer.  
15. Gently mix clump suspension; count viable cells or clumps (see Appendix 2).  
16. Seed clumps into fresh culture vessel at desired density in mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632.  
    - If large clumps > 400 – 500 µm formed, gently triturate 1–2 times with a 25 mL pipette (~1 mL/s) immediately before seeding.

| Initial Culture Volume (mL) | Strainer Tube Size          | Number and Volume of Pipette Passes            |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 2                          | Small (15 mL tube)         | 1 x 1 mL (5 mL serological pipette)            |
| 20                         | Large (50 mL tube)         | 1 x 5 mL (25 mL serological pipette)           |
| 50                         | Large (50 mL tube)         | 3 x 5 mL (25 mL serological pipette)           |
| 100                        | Large (50 mL tube)         | 3 x 10 mL (50 mL serological pipette)          |

## Potential Missing Parameters (compare to source)
- Centrifugation settings for cell collection after dissociation (e.g., 300 x g for 5 min) mentioned in the review checklist but not detailed in main protocol text.  
- Incubation time during preparation of clumps from aggregates notes "optimal incubation time may vary depending on cell line" but no guidance on range or how to optimize.  
- Shear force during pipetting through strainer: flow rate specified (~0.5 mL/second), but mechanical force details limited — possible variability not fully addressed.  
- Mixing speed details during culture only given as rpm and orbital diameter, but no explicit instructions on mixing mode or how to check uniformity of suspension.  
- No explicit provision of total culture passage duration beyond recommended 3-4 days, other than mention in troubleshooting.  

## Possible Unsupported Claims
- None detected. All claims related to cell behavior, morphology, and passage timing are supported or presented as observations with parameters consistent with the source text.  
- The claim about final passages' aggregate max size of 400 µm is emphasized consistently and supported by imagery and troubleshooting sections.  
- Statements about advantages of 3D culture and markers expression cite referenced data or logical outcomes.  

## Step Order / Omission Risks
- None detected. The protocol closely follows the source text sequence: media prep, vessel prep, 2D culture dissociation, seeding in suspension, feeding regimen, monitoring morphology, passaging using GCDR and 37 µm strainers, and troubleshooting.  
- Optional steps such as rinsing wells, filtering media, and additional rinsing during passaging are included as notes, preserving flexibility.  
- Use of Y-27632 addition timing is precise, avoiding premature addition.  
- Clump counting procedure is referenced but exact step integration depends on user, which is consistent with source protocol.  
- Feeding volumes and seeding densities scaling via tables mitigate risk for scaling mistakes.  

---

# Summary
The generated protocol includes critical numeric parameters from the source text with good fidelity. All major numeric values, volumes, concentrations, times, temperatures, rpm ranges, CO₂ levels, and passaging intervals are present and consistent. Minor parameters such as precise centrifugation force for cells post-dissociation are mentioned in a checklist but absence in main text is a mild gap. Mechanical details such as shear force during passaging and mixing uniformity could benefit from more clarification but are consistent with source. No unsupported claims or major procedural departures were observed.

**Recommendation:** Confirm centrifugation parameters for cell pelleting after dissociation if relevant, and consider adding guidance or alerts regarding pipetting shear force and culture mixing uniformity to reduce variability. Otherwise, the protocol is consistent with the source text and safe to use with standard cell culture expertise.
