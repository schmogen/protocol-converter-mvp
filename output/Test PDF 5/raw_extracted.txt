2.0 Introduction
A significant challenge in the field of human pluripotent stem cell research is the generation of large numbers
of highly pure undifferentiated cells. Although growing human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs; embryonic stem
[ES] cells and induced pluripotent stem [iPS] cells) in a two-dimensional (2D) adherent mTeSR™1 system
has long been the preferred method for maintenance of hPSCs, a standardized system to scale up hPSC
production has yet to be established. To meet this growing demand, we have developed mTeSR™3D, a
defined, serum-free formulation optimized for the expansion of undifferentiated hPSCs in a three-dimensional
(3D) suspension culture system.
mTeSR™3D uses a fed-batch strategy in which all the necessary nutrients and growth factors are added daily
and spent medium is only removed prior to passaging. The mTeSR™3D kit consists of a Seed Medium
(Basal Medium + 5X Supplement) to initiate cultures and a Feed Medium (Supplement A + Supplement B) for
daily fed-batch addition. The media contain recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (rh bFGF) and
recombinant human transforming growth factor β (rh TGFβ). Addition of further growth factors is not required.
mTeSR™3D Seed Medium requires addition of 10 µM Y-27632 for optimal aggregate formation.
In a traditional 2D hPSC culture system, cells are grown as adherent colonies or as a monolayer on a
2D surface that is usually coated with inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iMEFs) or a feeder-free
extracellular matrix (e.g. Matrigel®). By contrast, in the mTeSR™3D suspension culture system, cells grow as
spherical aggregates in suspension without the addition of matrices or microcarriers.
Compared to 2D, growing cells in a 3D fed-batch suspension system has a number of advantages:
• Eliminates the need to replace medium daily between passages
• Reduces fluctuations in pH and in the concentration of nutrients and growth factors associated
with a daily medium replacement
• No manual selection and removal of differentiated cells required
• Can be easily automated using liquid handling robots and facilitates high-throughput
experiments
Suspension hPSCs cultured in mTeSR™3D have been shown to:
• Transition efficiently from 2D cultures
• Yield more cells per mL of medium used than cells grown in 2D mTeSR™1 cultures
• Express equivalent levels of OCT4, TRA-1-60, and SSEA-3 (assessed by flow cytometry) as
cells grown in 2D mTeSR™1 cultures
• Have similar metabolic profiles compared to 2D mTeSR™1 cultures (glucose-to-lactate yield,
cell-specific glucose uptake rate, cell-specific lactate production rate)
• Maintain differentiation capacity to the 3 germ layers, similar to 2D mTeSR™1 cultures
• Have normal hPSC colony morphology when re-plated as 2D cultures

4.3 Suspension Culture Vessel Parameters
A variety of culture vessels can be used for growing hPSCs in suspension, depending on the desired culture
scale and the available systems in each laboratory. For small-scale optimization or high-throughput
experiments, we recommend non-tissue culture-treated 6-well plates (Catalog #38040). For large- scale
hPSC cultures, we recommend a larger vessel such as the Applikon MiniBio 500 bioreactor. Refer to Table 1
for culture vessels evaluated by STEMCELL Technologies along with the recommended volumes and
orbital/impeller speeds.

5.0 Initiating hPSC Suspension Culture in mTeSR™3D
Adherent 2D cultures grown on Corning® Matrigel® with mTeSR™1 can be transitioned directly into dynamic
suspension culture with no separate adaptation step. Note that some cell lines might expand less rapidly
during the first passage than in later passages.
5.1 High-Quality hPSC Cultures
To successfully expand cells and maintain pluripotency in a suspension culture system, it is crucial to begin
with high-quality hPSC cultures. Typically, hPSCs are maintained in 2D on Corning® Matrigel® with
mTeSR™1, and are passaged with Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent as clumps that are 50 - 100 µm in
diameter. Cells cultured in other 2D matrix-media combinations should also transition smoothly to 3D, but
some optimization may be needed. For additional information on maintaining hPSCs as adherent colony
cultures, refer to the Technical Manual: Maintenance of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells in mTeSR™1
(Document #28315), available at www.stemcell.com or contact us to request a copy.
High-quality hPSC cultures should express high levels of undifferentiated hPSC markers (> 95%) including
OCT4, TRA-1-60, and SSEA-3 as assessed by flow cytometry. They should also display normal colony
morphology and a low percentage of differentiated cells, have normal growth rates, and retain karyotype as
assessed by G-banding analysis or other method. Note that chromosomal and genetic aberrations may
appear during long-term passaging in any in vitro system. It is important to periodically check hPSC
maintenance cultures to ensure maintenance of normal karyotype. We recommend checking cultures every
10 passages.
5.2 Dissociating 2D Culture to Initiate 3D Suspension Culture
5.2.1 Choosing a Dissociation Method
hPSCs efficiently form aggregates in mTeSR™3D in suspension whether seeded as single cells or as small
clumps. One method may be preferred depending on the cell line and intended downstream applications.
In Table 2, clump passaging and single-cell passaging methods are compared.
A review of hPSC suspension culture literature reveals a diverse array of dissociation protocols, including
using ACCUTASE™1,2,3 or trypsin/EDTA4,5 to generate single cells; combinations of collagenase IV,
collagenase B, and TrypLE™ Select3,6,7,8; or mechanical dissociation to small clumps5,6.
In the mTeSR™3D culture system, we recommend a non-enzymatic clump passaging protocol using Gentle
Cell Dissociation Reagent (GCDR), which consistently yields undifferentiated aggregates in mTeSR™3D.
Refer to section 5.2.2 for initiating a 3D suspension culture from 2D, and section 7.3 for passaging
aggregates as clumps.

5.2.2 Seeding Small Clumps into Suspension
The protocol for initiating suspension cultures with small clumps derived from 2D adherent colony cultures will
be familiar to those who have passaged 2D colony cultures grown in mTeSR™1 with Gentle Cell Dissociation
Reagent (GCDR). GCDR is an enzyme-free reagent for passaging hPSCs as clumps with manual scraping to
generate small aggregates from 2D culture.
The following are instructions for passaging cells from one well of a 6-well plate cultured in mTeSR™1 on
Corning® Matrigel®. If using other cultureware, adjust volumes accordingly. Six wells of a confluent 6-well
plate of hPSCs should generate 6 - 12 x 106 viable cells, which is sufficient to seed a 20 - 50 mL mTeSR™3D
culture at a seeding density of 1 - 5 x 105 viable cells/mL. Refer to Table 3 for information about
recommended seeding densities.
1. Prepare and aliquot a sufficient volume of mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632 and warm to
room temperature (15 - 25°C).
Note: Do not warm mTeSR™3D Seed Medium in a 37°C water bath. Always use fresh mTeSR™3D Seed
Medium + Y-27632.
2. Use a microscope to visually identify regions of differentiation. Mark these using a felt tip or lens marker
on the bottom of the plate.
3. Remove regions of differentiation by scraping with a pipette tip or by aspiration. Avoid having the culture
plate out of the incubator for more than 15 minutes at a time.
Note: Selection may not be required if differentiation is < 5%. Selection should not exceed 20% of the
well. For further information, refer to the Technical Manual: Maintenance of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells
in mTeSR™1 (Document #28315), available at www.stemcell.com or contact us to request a copy.
4. Aspirate the spent medium from the well and add 1 mL of D-PBS (Without Ca++ and Mg++) at room
temperature (15 - 25°C).
5. Aspirate D-PBS from the well and add 1 mL of GCDR at room temperature (15 - 25°C).
6. Incubate at room temperature (15 - 25°C) for 6 - 8 minutes.

7. Aspirate GCDR. Add 1 mL of mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632. Gently detach the colonies
by scraping with a serological glass pipette or a cell scraper (e.g. Corning Catalog #3010 or Fisher
Catalog #08-100-240).
Note: Take care to avoid scraping the colonies into clumps which are too small.
8. Transfer the detached cell clumps to a 15 mL conical tube.
Optional: Rinse the well with an additional 1 mL of mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632 to collect
remaining clumps.
9. Carefully pipette the clump suspension up and down to break up the clumps as needed. A uniform
suspension of aggregates approximately 50 - 100 µm in size is optimal; do not create a single-cell
suspension.
10. Count the clumps by manual counting or by using an automated cell counting instrument such as a
ChemoMetec NucleoCounter® NC-250™. Refer to Appendix 2: Counting Clumps. For recommended
seeding densities, refer to Table 3 in section 5.3.
11. Add concentrated clump suspension to the culture vessel to obtain the desired number of total viable cells
or clumps and then top up medium with mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632 to desired total
volume.
5.3 Choosing an Optimal Seeding Density
Seeding a suspension culture at an appropriate density is important for aggregate formation efficiency, growth
rates, metabolite concentrations, and maintenance of pluripotency. Different cell lines have intrinsically
different growth rates, and thus may have different optimal seeding densities. Typically, seeding densities
range from 1 - 5 x 105 viable cells/mL, which correlates to approximately 1 - 5 x 103 clumps/mL. Final
harvested cell density at the end of a suspension culture passage should not exceed 1 - 2 x 106 viable
cells/mL.
Some cell lines may experience an adaptation phase during which they expand slowly in the first
1 - 2 passages in suspension culture. In these instances, it may be desirable to seed at higher densities in
early passages, and decrease the seeding density once the cells have adapted to suspension culture.
It is recommended to optimize seeding densities for individual cell lines in a small-scale suspension system
such as a non-tissue culture-treated 6-well plate, particularly for cell lines maintained in different 2D matrix-
medium combinations.

6.2 hPSC Aggregate Morphology
When culturing hPSCs as aggregates in mTeSR™3D, monitoring the morphology of aggregates by
microscopy and imaging is an important qualitative check. Divergence from typical aggregate morphology can
indicate that the aggregates may be nutrient-limited, differentiated, or necrotic. This section includes images
of typical undifferentiated hPSC aggregates over the course of a passage (Figures 1 - 2), as well as images of
hPSCs with poor aggregate morphology (Figure 3).
Typically, undifferentiated hPSC aggregates should not exceed 400 µm in diameter. If they grow much larger
than this, they may experience nutrient deficiency in the core of the aggregate and subsequent differentiation
and loss of expression of hPSC markers. See Troubleshooting (section 8.0) if aggregates are growing beyond
this size in a standard passage.
Cell aggregates should be mostly spherical, but not perfectly so, with some loose packing of cells around the
periphery. If spheres appear to have large bulbs or fully translucent areas, these could be signs of
differentiation. The appearance of shallow craters or pockmarks on the aggregate surface is associated with
high expression of hPSC markers and good expansion. If aggregates appear smooth and spherical, this can
indicate differentiation and loss of expression of hPSC markers.
When the core of the aggregate appears slightly darkened, this has no detrimental effect on aggregate
pluripotency. However, if the entire aggregate becomes very dark, this may indicate unhealthy aggregates
that have been over-seeded and may be limited by low nutrient concentrations. Monitoring the morphology of
aggregates over multiple passages, though qualitative, serves as an additional means to ensure high-quality
aggregate cultures of pure undifferentiated hPSCs.

7.0 Passaging Suspension Culture hPSCs Grown in
mTeSR™3D
7.1 Passaging Schedule
To prevent aggregates from getting excessively large (> 400 µm), we recommend an alternating 3-day/4-day
passaging schedule. If timed properly, no passaging will be required on weekends. Ensure that the mean
aggregate size does not exceed 400 µm; otherwise the core of the aggregates could become nutrient-
deficient, resulting in differentiation or cell death.
7.2 Choosing a Passaging Method
Aggregates in suspension grow in diameter over the course of a passage and must be dissociated and
re-seeded every 3 - 4 days. Dissociating aggregates to small clumps rather than single cells is recommended
to minimize the probability of selecting for sub-populations of cells with abnormal karyotypes that can gain
proliferative advantages in stressful single-cell environments. In section 7.3 a passaging method is described
in which aggregates are dissociated to small clumps using Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent and a
37 µm Reversible Strainer.
7.3 Passaging Aggregates as Small Clumps
Aggregates can be dissociated to small clumps (50 - 100 µm in diameter) using the following protocol in
which they are first treated with Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (GCDR), then resuspended in mTeSR™3D
Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632, and finally pushed through a 37 µm Reversible Strainer to generate small
clumps.
The described protocol is for the dissociation of aggregates from an initial culture volume of 20 mL and a
day 4 volume of ~26.7 mL. Volumes of GCDR and mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632 can be
scaled according to the culture volume (see Table 5).

5. Filter out non-aggregated single cells by passing the entire volume of the culture through a large 37 µm
Reversible Strainer into a 50 mL conical tube.
Note: For suspension cultures in a 6-well plate, the small 37 µm Reversible Strainer can be used with a
15 mL conical tube. Collect aggregates on the smaller side of the strainer with the arrow pointing up.
Note: If desired, cells in the filtrate can be quantified by centrifuging the collection tube, removing all but
~1 mL, and counting using a viability stain such as acridine orange (AO)/DAPI.
6. Flip the strainer onto a new 50 mL conical tube and rinse with 5 mL of warm GCDR, gently tapping the
strainer to dislodge all aggregates into the new tube.
7. After the aggregates are rinsed off the strainer, flip the strainer onto a second 50 mL conical tube and set
aside. This strainer can be used to dissociate aggregates into small clumps (step 13). Ensure that the
strainer side that contacted the aggregates is facing up to prevent any non-dissociated aggregates from
being re-seeded into the subsequent passage.
8. Incubate the conical tube containing aggregates and GCDR in a 37°C water bath for 6 minutes
(undisturbed).
Note: In this step, the aggregates are partially dissociated by the GCDR in preparation for generation of
small clumps (step 13).
Note: Optimal incubation time may vary depending on the cell line.
9. Gently remove the conical tube from the water bath without disturbing the cell pellet.
Note: For larger volumes of GCDR (> 5 mL), centrifuge the tube for 2 minutes at 100 x g to collect any
aggregates that have not settled.
10. Slowly aspirate the GCDR using a serological pipette, leaving ~0.5 mL to avoid removing any aggregates.
11. Add 5 mL of mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632 to the tube. Flick or gently swirl the tube to
resuspend the aggregates.
Note: If the culture has expanded > 5-fold over the course of the passage and aggregate density is high,
consider doubling the volume of mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632 used to resuspend the
aggregates prior to pushing through the 37 µm strainer.
12. Using a 25 mL serological pipette, remove the resuspended partially dissociated aggregates from the
tube.
Note: Ensure there are no bubbles at the end of the pipette tip prior to pushing the aggregates through
the strainer. Prevent bubbles by aspirating the aggregate suspension from the tube slowly. Remove
bubbles by shifting the pipette to a diagonal angle and tapping the pipette lightly on a tube to force the
bubbles upwards and away from the tip.
Note: Work quickly to prevent the aggregates from settling to the bottom of the pipette before pushing
through the strainer.
13. Using the strainer and new conical tube from step 7, place the pipette containing aggregates directly on
top of the strainer in a vertical orientation so that the pipette is level, with no gaps between it and the
strainer. With the slowest setting on the Pipette-Aid, pass the partially dissociated aggregates through the
strainer (0.5 mL/second flow rate). This will generate clumps of appropriate size to initiate the subsequent
passage. For larger culture volumes, a stepwise procedure is recommended (see Table 6).
Note: If the strainer appears clogged, slide the pipette laterally on the strainer while maintaining direct
contact with it. Alternatively, increasing the flow rate slightly can help to prevent clogging, but use the
lowest flow rate possible to minimize damage to the cells.

14. Optional: Rinse the tube from step 12 with 5 mL of additional mTeSR™3D Seed Medium + 10 µM
Y-27632. Pass through the strainer into the tube used in step 13 to collect any remaining aggregates from
the conical tube after GCDR dissociation.
Note: hPSC clumps may remain on the surface of the strainer after passing the partially dissociated
aggregates through it. Minimize loss by adjusting the flow rate and volume of flow-through for individual
cell lines. To increase yield, rinse the strainer with an additional 1 - 5 mL of mTeSR™3D Seed Medium +
10 µM Y-27632.
15. Gently resuspend the clump suspension. Remove a sample for counting viable cells or clumps
(see Appendix 2: Counting Clumps).
16. Seed the clumps into a new culture vessel by adding the concentrated clump suspension to mTeSR™3D
Seed Medium + 10 µM Y-27632 at room temperature (15 - 25°C) and topping up with additional medium
to the desired final volume and cell density.
Note: Clumps may aggregate if left for extended periods of time (> 15 minutes) as a pellet. If very large
clumps have formed (> 400 - 500 µm), gently triturate the entire clump suspension 1 - 2 times using a
25 mL serological pipette at a flow rate of ~1 mL per second immediately before seeding.

10.0 Appendix 1: Preparing Suspension Culture Vessels
10.1.1 Coating Polycarbonate Vessels
If cells are sticking to the vessel walls of your polycarbonate culture vessel, it is recommended to coat the
vessels with Anti-Adherence Rinsing Solution prior to inoculation. Anti-Adherence Rinsing Solution contains a
hydrophobic surfactant that prevents cells from sticking to the vessel walls. Cell sticking can also be
minimized by decreasing the shear in the system.
1. Obtain a new Corning® 125 mL Polycarbonate Erlenmeyer Flask or Qorpak® 300 mL Polycarbonate
Round Bottle.
2. Add 20 mL Anti-Adherence Rinsing Solution and close the lid tightly.
Note: If culturing > 20 mL, increase the volume of AggreWell™Rinsing Solution to equal the initial culture
volume.
3. Incubate at 37°C for 15 minutes on a shaker at 145 rpm.
4. Remove from the incubator and remove the Anti-Adherence Rinsing Solution.
5. Add 10 mL of warm (room temperature; 15 - 25°C) DMEM/F-12. Close lid tightly, then swirl and rotate the
bottle to rinse all surfaces without allowing DMEM/F-12 to go into the lid. Remove DMEM/F-12.
6. Repeat step 5 two more times.
7. Close the lid tightly until ready to use.
10.1.2 Cleaning and Coating Glass Spinner Flasks
Cleaning and coating reusable glass spinner flasks (such as the INTEGRA CELLSPIN models) prior to adding
cells is recommended to remove debris and to prevent cells from sticking to the vessel walls.
Note: The full cleaning and coating procedure does not need to be repeated prior to each use. At a minimum,
clean the glass with warm distilled water and a gentle brush between uses followed by autoclaving. Monitor
the glass over the course of each experiment for cell and debris adherence. Repeat the full cleaning and
coating procedure when the cell debris adherence is noticeable. Do not use detergents, or cleaning tools that
have come in contact with detergents, on glass spinner flasks.
1. Ensure that the glass surface of the spinner flask is clean and free of debris.
Note: Use warm distilled water and soft brush to remove debris if necessary.
2. Prepare a 0.1 M solution of NaOH in distilled water.
3. Add 0.1 M NaOH to the spinner flask and soak for 30 - 60 minutes at room temperature (15 - 25°C).
Note: Volume of NaOH should be greater than or equal to the anticipated volume of suspension culture
by the end of the culture passage.
4. Discard NaOH. Rinse thoroughly 3 times with an equal volume of distilled water.
5. Allow the glass to air dry until no moisture remains on surface.
6. Add 2 mL of Sigmacote® to the spinner flask. Using a serological pipette, rinse all surfaces that will
contact cells, including the pendulum or impeller.
Note: Work in a fume hood when using Sigmacote®. Excess Sigmacote® can be removed and reused.
If disposing of excess Sigmacote®, do so in accordance with your institution's policies.
7. Leave the flask in a chemical fume hood overnight to allow the glass surface to dry completely.
8. Rinse with a large volume (to the level of the side-arms) of distilled water 3 times.
9. Autoclave the glass spinner flask in a standard dry autoclave cycle (121°C for 30 minutes).
10. Rinse the surface three times with DMEM/F-12 prior to use.
Note: Rinse volume should be approximately 50% of the volume anticipated for cell culture.

11.0 Appendix 2: Counting Clumps
Accurate and precise quantification of clumps dissociated from 2D and 3D cultures is critical for measuring
expansion and accurately seeding subsequent passages. Two methods for counting clumps are described
below. The first method, Manual Clump Counting, can be performed by any lab with an inverted microscope
and is identical to the method used to count clumps for mTeSR™1 colony passaging. The second method,
Viable Nuclei Counting, requires an image-based cell counting instrument such as the ChemoMetec
NucleoCounter® NC-250™ in combination with a viability stain.
Manual Clump Counting
Count clumps ≥ 50 µm in diameter, as these are the most likely to form aggregates of ideal size.
1. Draw a “+” centered on the bottom of 2 wells of a 96-well flat-bottom plate (e.g. Catalog #38022) to serve
as a counting grid.
2. Aliquot 40 µL of DMEM/F-12 into each well.
3. Add 5 µL of a freshly dissociated and resuspended clump suspension to each well. Ensure that the clump
suspension is well-mixed prior to removing the sample for counting.
4. Count the clumps in each well that are ≥ 50 µm in diameter. Average the results from the two wells to
obtain the average number of clumps (N ) in the 5 µL sample.
A
5. Calculate the concentration of clumps (C) and the total number of clumps (N ) using the total volume of
T
the clump suspension in µL (V ):
T
C = (N / 5 µL)
A
N = C x V
T T
6. Determine the target number of clumps to seed (N ) by referring to Table 3 for the optimal seeding
p
density and multiplying by volume.
7. Calculate the volume (in µL) of clump suspension to seed (V ) for each condition in your experiment:
p
V = N / C
P P
8. Gently mix the clump suspension prior to seeding to ensure a uniform suspension.
9. Add calculated volume of clump suspension (V ) to the culture vessel and add mTeSR™3D Seed
P
Medium + Y-27632 to desired volume.
Viable Nuclei Counting
Alternatively, clump cultures can be quantified as viable cells/mL using an image-based cell counting
instrument such as the ChemoMetec NucleoCounter® NC-250™ in combination with a viability stain.

12.0 Appendix 3: Differentiating Suspension Cultures into
Three Germ Layers
hPSCs grown in suspension culture with mTeSR™3D have the ability to differentiate to the three germ layers
– mesoderm, definitive endoderm, and ectoderm.
Cells derived from hPSC suspension culture tend to have a higher plating efficiency than those derived from
2D mTeSR™1 cultures when seeded as a monolayer for differentiation protocols. If cultures appear
overgrown compared to 2D controls on day 1 of a differentiation protocol, consider lowering the seeding
density to achieve desired confluency for differentiation.
Generate a single-cell suspension using an enzymatic reagent, then use STEMdiff™ Trilineage Differentiation
Kit (Catalog #05230) to differentiate cells to the three germ layers.

14.0 Appendix 5: G-Banding Karyotype
To assess whether chromosomal abnormalities have been acquired or have increased in prevalence in
suspension cultures, it is recommended to assess the karyotype at the beginning and end of an experiment.
All STEMCELL Technologies G-banding karyotypes are analyzed by WiCell Research Institute in Wisconsin,
USA.
The resolution of G-banding karyotype is limited to > 5 Mb. For higher resolution of variations in gene copy
number, deletions, duplications, and other genotypic changes, consider using fluorescent in situ hybridization
(FISH), SNP genotyping, RT-PCR, or microarrays.
G-banding karyotypes are also limited in the number of spreads analyzed. Due to the laborious nature of the
protocol, only 20 - 30 cells are analyzed per culture. Low-frequency sub-populations of abnormal cells can go
undetected in both maintenance and experimental cultures. Improper culture techniques may increase the
frequency of genetically abnormal cells in culture.

15.0 Appendix 6: Dissociating Aggregates to Single Cells
for Flow Cytometry
The following are instructions for preparing a single-cell suspension from aggregate cultures grown in
mTeSR™3D in non-tissue culture-treated 6-well plates. If using other cultureware, adjust volumes
accordingly. Cultures should be harvested at the time they would normally be ready for passaging.
1. Aliquot and warm an appropriate enzymatic cell dissociation reagent to 37°C.
2. Warm medium (DMEM/F-12 or mTeSR™3D Seed Medium) and D-PBS (Without Ca++ and Mg++) to
room temperature (15 - 25°C) before use.
3. Filter out non-aggregated single cells by transferring the entire volume of culture through a small 37 µm
Reversible Strainer into a 15 mL conical tube.
Note: Collect aggregates on the smaller side of strainer with the arrow pointing up.
4. Flip the strainer onto a new 15 mL conical tube and rinse with 2 mL of D-PBS (Without Ca++ and Mg++),
tapping strainer to release all aggregates.
5. Allow aggregates to settle for 3 - 5 minutes, then remove D-PBS.
6. Add 1 mL of warm enzymatic reagent. Incubate at 37°C for 7 minutes.
Note: The incubation time may vary for different cell lines and enzymatic reagents.
7. Dissociate the aggregates by pipetting up and down to create a single-cell suspension.
8. Add 2 - 4 mL of medium (DMEM/F-12 or mTeSR™3D Seed Medium).
9. Centrifuge cells at 300 x g for 5 minutes.
10. Resuspend cells in an appropriate medium for desired downstream applications (e.g. 2% FBS/PBS for
flow cytometry).
