Table 1 Materials required for all isolations Product information Item Source Invitrogen™ TRIzol™ Reagent is a ready-to-use reagent, designed to isolate high quality total RNA (as well as DNA and proteins) from cell Equipment and tissue samples of human, animal, plant, yeast, or bacterial origin, Centrifuge and rotor capable of reaching MLS within one hour. TRIzol™ Reagent is a monophasic solution of phenol, 12,000 × g and 4°C guanidine isothiocyanate, and other proprietary components which Tubes facilitate the isolation of a variety of RNA species of large or small Polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes MLS molecular size. TRIzol™ Reagent maintains the integrity of the RNA Reagents due to highly effective inhibition of RNase activity while disrupting Chloroform MLS cells and dissolving cell components during sample homogenization. TRIzol™ Reagent allows for simultaneous processing of a large number Table 2 Materials required for DNA isolation of samples, and is an improvement to the single-step RNA isolation Item Source method developed by Chomcynski and Sacchi (Chomczynski and Reagents Sacchi, 1987). Ethanol, 100% MLS TRIzol™ Reagent allows to perform sequential precipitation of RNA, Ethanol, 75% MLS DNA, and proteins from a single sample (Chomczynski, 1993). After homogenizing the sample with TRIzol™ Reagent, chloroform is added, 0.1 M sodium citrate in 10% ethanol MLS and the homogenate is allowed to separate into a clear upper aqueous 8 mM NaOH MLS layer (containing RNA), an interphase, and a red lower organic layer HEPES MLS (containing the DNA and proteins). RNA is precipitated from the aqueous layer with isopropanol. DNA is precipitated from the Input sample requirements interphase/organic layer with ethanol. Protein is precipitated from the IMPORTANT! Perform DNA isolation immediately after sample phenol-ethanol supernatant by isopropanol precipitation. The collection or quick-freeze samples immediately after collection and precipitated RNA, DNA, or protein is washed to remove impurities, store at –80°C or in liquid nitrogen until DNA isolation. and then resuspended for use in downstream applications. • Isolated RNA can be used in RT-PCR, Northern Blot analysis, Dot Starting material per 1 mL of Sample type Blot hybridization, poly(A)+ selection, in vitro translation, RNase TRIzol™ Reagent protection assay, and molecular cloning.
