## Critical Parameters Checklist (from the protocol)
- Temperature: Room temperature (20–25°C); centrifugation at 4°C  
- TRIzol™ volume per sample:  
  - Tissues: 1 mL per 50–100 mg  
  - Monolayer cells: 0.3–0.4 mL per 1 × 10^5–10^7 cells  
  - Suspension cells: 0.75 mL per 0.25 mL of cell pellet (5–10 × 10^6 animal/plant/yeast or 1 × 10^7 bacterial cells)  
- Chloroform: 0.2 mL per 1 mL TRIzol™  
- Ethanol (100%): 0.3 mL per 1 mL TRIzol™  
- Sodium citrate wash: 1 mL 0.1 M sodium citrate in 10% ethanol per 1 mL TRIzol™ (repeat wash once or twice for large pellets)  
- Ethanol (75%): 1.5–2 mL per 1 mL TRIzol™  
- NaOH for solubilization: 0.3–0.6 mL 8 mM NaOH  
- Centrifugation settings:  
  - Lysate clarification (optional): 5 min, 12,000 × g, 4–10°C  
  - Phase separation: 15 min, 12,000 × g, 4°C  
  - DNA pellet: 5 min, 2,000 × g, 4°C  
  - DNA pellet wash centrifugations: 5 min, 2,000 × g, 4°C  
  - Insoluble removal after DNA resuspension: 10 min, 12,000 × g, 4°C  
- Incubations:  
  - Nucleoprotein dissociation: 5 min at RT  
  - Post-ethanol DNA precipitation incubation: 2–3 min RT  
  - Sodium citrate wash incubation: 30 min RT (mixing occasionally)  
  - 75% ethanol wash incubation: 10–20 min RT (mixing occasionally)  
  - Pellet drying: 5–10 min (air or vacuum, not vacuum centrifuge)  
- Storage:  
  - Samples: 4°C overnight or –20°C up to a year before DNA isolation  
  - Protein fraction: –70°C for months  
  - DNA: 4°C overnight or –20°C with pH adjustment and 1 mM EDTA  

## Potential Missing Parameters (compare to source)
- "Sample volume should not exceed 10% of TRIzol™ volume" for lysis step is missing or unclear.  
- The protocol does not explicitly state to "Remove any remaining aqueous phase carefully" before DNA precipitation as a critical step (though step 11 says remove remaining aqueous phase, explicit emphasis is less).  
- No mention of gentle inversion/mixing frequency/duration during sodium citrate and ethanol washes beyond "mix occasionally".  
- No specific instructions on preventing mRNA degradation by not washing cells prior to lysis appear explicitly in the protocol steps (only in notes).  
- No explicit instruction for keeping steps aseptic or use of RNaseZap or decontamination methods for surfaces and equipment.  
- No explicit caution regarding not drying DNA pellet by vacuum centrifuge emphasized in the steps, although stated as important.  
- Absence of specific mention on adjusting pH of DNA resuspension with HEPES to 7–8 for long-term storage with 1 mM EDTA is mentioned but pH adjustment details before storage are minimal.  
- The protocol does not include instruction related to handling samples with high fat content beyond a single optional centrifugation — no parameters for this centrifugation other than brief mention (5 min, 12,000 × g, 4–10°C).  

## Possible Hallucinations / Unsupported Claims
- None detected. The protocol content aligns well with the source text; wording differences are present but no unsupported steps or parameters introduced.  

## Step Order / Omission Risks
- None detected. The step order corresponds closely to the source text, including sample lysis, phase separation, DNA precipitation, washing, solubilization, and optional yield determination.  
- The only minor risk is that the protocol places some points (e.g., RNase contamination prevention, temperature handling) in notes rather than integrated into procedure steps, which may lead to user oversight.
