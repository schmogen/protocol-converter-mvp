## Critical Parameters Checklist (from the protocol)

- Temperature:
  - Room temperature (20–25°C) for most steps
  - 4°C for centrifugation steps
  - 4–10°C centrifugation optional for high-fat samples
  - Storage: 4°C overnight, –20°C longer storage, –70°C for protein supernatant
- Centrifugation:
  - 12,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min (optional for fat removal)
  - 12,000 × g at 4°C for 15 min (phase separation)
  - 2,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min (DNA pellet)
  - 12,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min (DNA solubilization)
- Volumes:
  - 1 mL TRIzol per 50–100 mg tissue
  - 0.3–0.4 mL TRIzol per 1 × 10^5–10^7 monolayer cells
  - 0.75 mL TRIzol per 0.25 mL of suspension sample
  - 0.2 mL chloroform per 1 mL TRIzol
  - 0.3 mL 100% ethanol per 1 mL TRIzol
  - 1 mL 0.1 M sodium citrate in 10% ethanol per 1 mL TRIzol (wash)
  - 1.5–2 mL 75% ethanol per 1 mL TRIzol (wash)
  - 0.3–0.6 mL 8 mM NaOH for DNA solubilization
- Incubation times:
  - 5 min after lysis before chloroform
  - 2–3 min after chloroform addition
  - 2–3 min ethanol precipitation incubation
  - 30 min wash in sodium citrate/ethanol
  - 10–20 min wash in 75% ethanol
  - 5–10 min air or vacuum drying DNA pellet (avoid vacuum centrifuge)
- pH:
  - Sodium citrate in 10% ethanol at pH 8.5
  - Adjust pH with HEPES in final DNA solution; 7–8 for long term storage

## Potential Missing Parameters (compare to source)

- Media removal for cells grown in monolayer is mentioned in source but step detailing removal is brief; the protocol mentions remove media but no specified method or time.
- No explicit mention of using cold TRIzol for tissues with high RNase (e.g., spleen/pancreas) is flagged in notes but no detailed instructions about temperature of TRIzol at use.
- Optional centrifugation after lysis for high fat content is noted but without specific mention of precise temp range (4–10°C is in source, protocol states 4–10°C).
- The source mentions "pipetting lysate up and down several times" vs protocol’s "pipetting up and down"—slight difference in emphasis.
- The recommendation to not wash cells before adding TRIzol to avoid mRNA degradation is mentioned but no procedural emphasis on avoiding washing other than in notes.
- The source mentions storing DNA in sodium citrate/ethanol for at least 2 hours; the protocol states at least 2 hours but does not advise max storage before next step.
- The use of RNaseZap™ is mentioned in materials and notes but no specific step for surface decontamination is present in the procedure besides a general note.
- Adjust pH for DNA storage with addition of 1 mM EDTA for long-term storage is stated in protocol with recommendation from source; explicit caution or concentration of EDTA is supported but somewhat minimal in protocol.

## Possible Unsupported Claims

- None detected. The protocol closely follows details from the source text without making unsupported statements.

## Step Order / Omission Risks

- The order of phases separation, DNA precipitation, washing, and solubilization matches source text.
- The protocol omits explicit step-by-step instructions for preparation of starting material beyond tissue and cells; e.g., no mention of cutting tissue into smaller pieces, which source notes as possible troubleshooting.
- Optional centrifugation for high fat lysates is left as optional; consistent with source.
- No explicit mention of storage conditions for DNA between washes or after solubilization apart from overnight at 4°C and longer-term at –20°C; partial details but possibly incomplete.
- No detailed instructions on how to handle large DNA pellets beyond repeat wash cycles; protocol states repeat more wash cycles but no instructions what to do if pellet is too small or fragile.
- No mention of precipitation or processing of RNA or protein phases beyond noting protein supernatant can be stored or used later.

Overall, the protocol is comprehensive but some minor items on RNase control and starting material preparation steps could present risks if omitted or unclear.
