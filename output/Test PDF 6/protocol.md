# TRIzol™ Reagent Experimental Protocol for DNA Isolation

## Objective
To isolate high-quality DNA from cell and tissue samples using TRIzol™ Reagent following RNA extraction, enabling sequential recovery of RNA, DNA, and proteins from a single sample.

## Materials
- Invitrogen™ TRIzol™ Reagent  
- Chloroform  
- Ethanol, 100%  
- Ethanol, 75%  
- 0.1 M sodium citrate in 10% ethanol (pH 8.5)  
- 8 mM NaOH  
- HEPES  
- Polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes  
- Centrifuge and rotor capable of reaching 12,000 × g and 4°C  
- Sterile plastic ware (individually wrapped)  
- Sterile, disposable RNase-free pipettes, pipette tips, and tubes  
- Homogenizer (for tissue samples)  

## Procedure

### 1. Sample Preparation and Lysis
1. Perform all steps at room temperature (20–25°C) unless otherwise indicated.  
2. Use disposable plastic ware and change gloves frequently to prevent RNase contamination.  
3. Prepare samples according to the following:
   - **Tissues:** Add 1 mL TRIzol™ Reagent per 50–100 mg tissue, then homogenize.  
   - **Cells grown in monolayer:**
     - Remove growth media.  
     - Add 0.3–0.4 mL TRIzol™ Reagent per 1 × 10^5–10^7 cells directly to the culture dish to lyse cells.  
     - Pipet lysate up and down several times to homogenize.
   - **Cells grown in suspension:**
     - Pellet cells by centrifugation and discard supernatant.  
     - Add 0.75 mL TRIzol™ Reagent per 0.25 mL cell pellet (5–10 × 10^6 animal, plant, or yeast cells, or 1 × 10^7 bacterial cells).  
     - Pipet up and down to homogenize.

### 2. Phase Separation
4. (Optional) For high fat content samples, centrifuge lysate for 5 min at 12,000 × g, 4–10°C, and transfer clear supernatant to a new tube.  
5. Incubate the lysate for 5 min at room temperature to dissociate nucleoprotein complexes.  
6. Add 0.2 mL chloroform per 1 mL TRIzol™ Reagent used, cap securely.  
7. Incubate 2–3 min at room temperature.  
8. Centrifuge for 15 min at 12,000 × g, 4°C.  
9. The mixture separates into:
   - Upper aqueous phase (contains RNA)  
   - Interphase  
   - Lower red phenol-chloroform organic phase (contains DNA and proteins)  
10. Discard the aqueous phase carefully; proceed with interphase and organic phase for DNA isolation immediately after collection or freeze samples at –80°C or in liquid nitrogen.

### 3. DNA Precipitation
11. Remove any remaining aqueous phase overlying the interphase.  
12. Add 0.3 mL of 100% ethanol per 1 mL TRIzol™ Reagent used for lysis.  
13. Cap tube, mix by inverting several times.  
14. Incubate 2–3 min at room temperature.  
15. Centrifuge 5 min at 2,000 × g, 4°C to pellet DNA.  
16. Transfer phenol-ethanol supernatant to a new tube for protein isolation or storage at –70°C.

### 4. DNA Washing
17. Resuspend DNA pellet in 1 mL of 0.1 M sodium citrate in 10% ethanol (pH 8.5) per 1 mL TRIzol™ Reagent used.  
18. Incubate 30 min at room temperature, mixing occasionally by gentle inversion.  
19. Centrifuge 5 min at 2,000 × g, 4°C.  
20. Discard supernatant with micropipettor.  
21. Repeat steps 17–20 once.  
   - For large DNA pellets (>200 µg), repeat wash steps twice.  
22. Resuspend pellet in 1.5–2 mL 75% ethanol per 1 mL TRIzol™ Reagent used.  
23. Incubate 10–20 min at room temperature, mixing occasionally by gentle inversion.  
24. Centrifuge 5 min at 2,000 × g, 4°C.  
25. Discard supernatant with micropipettor.  
26. Vacuum or air dry the pellet for 5–10 min.  
   - **Important:** Do not dry the pellet by vacuum centrifuge.

### 5. DNA Solubilization
27. Resuspend pellet in 0.3–0.6 mL of 8 mM NaOH by pipetting up and down.  
   - DNA resuspends better in mild base than in water or Tris buffer.  
28. Centrifuge 10 min at 12,000 × g, 4°C to remove insoluble material.  
29. Transfer supernatant to a new tube, adjust pH with HEPES as needed.  
30. Proceed to downstream applications or:
   - Store DNA at 4°C overnight.  
   - For long-term storage at –20°C, adjust pH to 7–8 with HEPES and add 1 mM EDTA.

### 6. DNA Yield Determination (Optional)
31. Measure DNA concentration by:
   - **Absorbance:** Dilute sample in water or buffer (pH >7.5); measure absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm.  
     - Calculate DNA concentration: A260 × 50 = µg DNA/mL.  
     - Assess purity by A260/A280 ratio; ~1.8 is considered pure.  
   - **Fluorescence:** Use Qubit™ or Quant-iT™ dsDNA Assay Kits according to kit instructions.  

## Notes
- Do not wash cells before adding TRIzol™ Reagent to avoid mRNA degradation.  
- Use cold TRIzol™ Reagent for samples with high RNase content (e.g., spleen, pancreas).  
- Samples can be stored at 4°C overnight or at –20°C for up to a year before DNA isolation.  
- DNA yields vary by sample type:  
  - Fibroblasts or cultured mammalian cells (1 × 10^6 cells): 5–7 µg DNA  
  - Skeletal muscle, brain, placenta (1 mg): 2–3 µg DNA  
  - Liver, kidney (1 mg): 3–4 µg DNA

## Potential Missing Parameters (compare to source)
- "Sample volume should not exceed 10% of TRIzol™ volume" for lysis step is missing or unclear.  
- The protocol does not explicitly state to "Remove any remaining aqueous phase carefully" before DNA precipitation as a critical step (though step 11 says remove remaining aqueous phase, explicit emphasis is less).  
- No mention of gentle inversion/mixing frequency/duration during sodium citrate and ethanol washes beyond "mix occasionally".  
- No specific instructions on preventing mRNA degradation by not washing cells prior to lysis appear explicitly in the protocol steps (only in notes).  
- No explicit instruction for keeping steps aseptic or use of RNaseZap or decontamination methods for surfaces and equipment.  
- No explicit caution regarding not drying DNA pellet by vacuum centrifuge emphasized in the steps, although stated as important.  
- Absence of specific mention on adjusting pH of DNA resuspension with HEPES to 7–8 for long-term storage with 1 mM EDTA is mentioned but pH adjustment details before storage are minimal.  
- The protocol does not include instruction related to handling samples with high fat content beyond a single optional centrifugation — no parameters for this centrifugation other than brief mention (5 min, 12,000 × g, 4–10°C).  

## Possible Hallucinations / Unsupported Claims
- None detected. The protocol content aligns well with the source text; wording differences are present but no unsupported steps or parameters introduced.  

## Step Order / Omission Risks
- None detected. The step order corresponds closely to the source text, including sample lysis, phase separation, DNA precipitation, washing, solubilization, and optional yield determination.  
- The only minor risk is that the protocol places some points (e.g., RNase contamination prevention, temperature handling) in notes rather than integrated into procedure steps, which may lead to user oversight.
