## Procedure

### Sample Preparation and Lysis

1. Perform all steps at room temperature (20–25°C) unless otherwise noted.
2. Prepare samples according to type:
   - **Tissues:** Add 1 mL of TRIzol™ Reagent per 50–100 mg tissue. Homogenize thoroughly.
   - **Cells grown in monolayer:**
     - Remove growth media.
     - Add 0.3–0.4 mL of TRIzol™ Reagent per 1 × 10^5–10^7 cells directly to the culture dish.
     - Pipet lysate up and down to homogenize.
   - **Cells grown in suspension:**
     - Pellet cells by centrifugation and discard supernatant.
     - Add 0.75 mL of TRIzol™ Reagent per 0.25 mL of sample (5–10 × 10^6 animal, plant, or yeast cells or 1 × 10^7 bacterial cells).
     - Pipet lysate up and down several times to homogenize.

### Phase Separation

3. (Optional) For samples with high fat content, centrifuge lysate for 5 minutes at 12,000 × g at 4–10°C and transfer the clear supernatant to a new tube.
4. Incubate lysate for 5 minutes at room temperature to dissociate nucleoprotein complexes.
5. Add 0.2 mL chloroform per 1 mL TRIzol™ Reagent. Cap tube securely.
6. Incubate for 2–3 minutes at room temperature.
7. Centrifuge for 15 minutes at 12,000 × g and 4°C. The mixture separates into:
   - Colorless upper aqueous phase (RNA)
   - Interphase (DNA)
   - Lower red phenol-chloroform phase (DNA and proteins)

### DNA Precipitation

8. Carefully remove and discard the aqueous phase.
9. Remove any remaining aqueous phase overlying the interphase carefully.
10. Add 0.3 mL of 100% ethanol per 1 mL TRIzol™ Reagent used for lysis.
11. Cap tube and mix by inverting several times.
12. Incubate for 2–3 minutes at room temperature.
13. Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 2,000 × g and 4°C to pellet DNA.
14. Transfer phenol-ethanol supernatant to a new tube for protein isolation or storage at –70°C.

### DNA Washing

15. Resuspend DNA pellet in 1 mL of 0.1 M sodium citrate in 10% ethanol (pH 8.5) per 1 mL TRIzol™ Reagent used.
16. Incubate for 30 minutes, mixing occasionally by gentle inversion.
17. Centrifuge 5 minutes at 2,000 × g and 4°C.
18. Remove supernatant carefully with micropipette.
19. Repeat steps 15–18 once. For large DNA pellets (>200 µg), repeat twice.
20. Resuspend pellet in 1.5–2 mL of 75% ethanol per 1 mL TRIzol™ Reagent used.
21. Incubate 10–20 minutes, mixing occasionally by gentle inversion.
22. Centrifuge 5 minutes at 2,000 × g, 4°C.
23. Remove supernatant with micropipette.
24. Air or vacuum dry pellet for 5–10 minutes.
   - **Important:** Do not dry DNA pellet by vacuum centrifuge.

### DNA Solubilization

25. Resuspend pellet in 0.3–0.6 mL of 8 mM NaOH by pipetting up and down.
26. Centrifuge 10 minutes at 12,000 × g and 4°C to remove insoluble material.
27. Transfer supernatant to a new tube.
28. Adjust pH as needed with HEPES.
29. Use immediately or store at 4°C overnight.
30. For long-term storage at –20°C, adjust pH to 7–8 with HEPES and add 1 mM EDTA.

### DNA Quantification

31. Determine DNA yield using one of the following methods:

   - **Absorbance:**
     1. Dilute DNA sample in water or buffer (pH >7.5).
     2. Measure absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm.
     3. Calculate concentration: A260 × 50 = µg DNA/mL.
     4. Calculate A260/A280 ratio; ~1.8 indicates purity.

   - **Fluorescence:**
     - Measure dsDNA using Qubit™ or Quant-iT™ dsDNA Assay Kits following manufacturer instructions.

## Notes

- Do not wash cells before adding TRIzol™ Reagent to prevent mRNA degradation.
- Use sterile, RNase-free disposables and wear gloves, changing frequently to avoid RNase contamination.
- If samples contain high RNase levels (e.g., spleen or pancreas), use cold TRIzol™ Reagent.
- Samples can be stored at 4°C overnight or at –20°C for up to one year before DNA isolation.
- DNA can be stored in sodium citrate/ethanol for at least 2 hours or in 75% ethanol at 4°C for several months.
- Avoid incomplete removal of aqueous phase to prevent DNA contamination.
- Do not dry DNA pellet using vacuum centrifuge.

## Potential Missing Parameters (compare to source)

- Media removal for cells grown in monolayer is mentioned in source but step detailing removal is brief; the protocol mentions remove media but no specified method or time.
- No explicit mention of using cold TRIzol for tissues with high RNase (e.g., spleen/pancreas) is flagged in notes but no detailed instructions about temperature of TRIzol at use.
- Optional centrifugation after lysis for high fat content is noted but without specific mention of precise temp range (4–10°C is in source, protocol states 4–10°C).
- The source mentions "pipetting lysate up and down several times" vs protocol’s "pipetting up and down"—slight difference in emphasis.
- The recommendation to not wash cells before adding TRIzol to avoid mRNA degradation is mentioned but no procedural emphasis on avoiding washing other than in notes.
- The source mentions storing DNA in sodium citrate/ethanol for at least 2 hours; the protocol states at least 2 hours but does not advise max storage before next step.
- The use of RNaseZap™ is mentioned in materials and notes but no specific step for surface decontamination is present in the procedure besides a general note.
- Adjust pH for DNA storage with addition of 1 mM EDTA for long-term storage is stated in protocol with recommendation from source; explicit caution or concentration of EDTA is supported but somewhat minimal in protocol.

## Possible Unsupported Claims

- None detected. The protocol closely follows details from the source text without making unsupported statements.

## Step Order / Omission Risks

- The order of phases separation, DNA precipitation, washing, and solubilization matches source text.
- The protocol omits explicit step-by-step instructions for preparation of starting material beyond tissue and cells; e.g., no mention of cutting tissue into smaller pieces, which source notes as possible troubleshooting.
- Optional centrifugation for high fat lysates is left as optional; consistent with source.
- No explicit mention of storage conditions for DNA between washes or after solubilization apart from overnight at 4°C and longer-term at –20°C; partial details but possibly incomplete.
- No detailed instructions on how to handle large DNA pellets beyond repeat wash cycles; protocol states repeat more wash cycles but no instructions what to do if pellet is too small or fragile.
- No mention of precipitation or processing of RNA or protein phases beyond noting protein supernatant can be stored or used later.

Overall, the protocol is comprehensive but some minor items on RNase control and starting material preparation steps could present risks if omitted or unclear.
