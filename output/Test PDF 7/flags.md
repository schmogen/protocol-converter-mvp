## Critical Parameters Checklist (from the protocol)
- Bead concentration for nucleic acid immobilization: 5 µg/µL in 2X B&W Buffer  
- Incubation times:  
  - General immobilization: 15–30 min at room temperature  
  - Nucleic acids: short oligonucleotides <30 bases up to 10 min; DNA up to 1 kb, 15 min  
  - Antibodies/proteins: 30 min at room temperature  
- Washing:  
  - Washing times: typically 1–5 min (mixing at least 5 min recommended)  
  - Number of washes: 3–5 times for coated beads  
  - RNA application washes: 2 × Solution A for 2 min, 1 × Solution B (times mentioned)  
- Volumes: equal volume of buffer to beads or at least 1 mL during washing  
- Magnet separation time: 1–3 min  
- Buffer compositions used explicitly (e.g., PBS pH 7.4, PBS/BSA 0.1%, Tween 0.01–0.1%)  
- Tween™ 20 concentration for reducing nonspecific binding: 0.01–0.1%  
- Free biotin removal recommended (no numeric detail)  
- Storage temperature for buffers: 2 to 8°C (from source but not re-stated in protocol)  

## Potential Missing Parameters (compare to source)
- Source specifies buffer pH ranges for binding/washing buffers typically 5–9; protocol only mentions pH 7.4 PBS based buffers without explicit pH variations  
- Salt concentration adjustment in immobilization step for nucleic acids: Source details dilution from 2 M to 1 M NaCl during nucleic acid immobilization. Protocol states this but lacks precision on starting buffer salt concentrations (Solution B details are fragmented, e.g., Solution B is 2 M NaCl in source but protocol states 2X B&W Buffer used to achieve 2 M NaCl) — may cause ambiguity.  
- The source mentions use of detergent Tween specifically for some applications with concentrations 0.01–0.1%, protocol correctly notes this but does not clarify when exactly addition during binding is recommended vs only in wash buffer  
- The source states beads contain ~6–7 × 10^8 beads/mL at 10 mg/mL, which affects binding capacity calculations; the protocol does not mention beads per mL or bead counts  
- Sample volume or total reaction volume is not always specified or suggested (e.g., no explicit total volume for immobilization or washing steps)  
- Source suggests that incubation time for bead resuspension is vortex >30 s or tilt/rotate 5 min; protocol specifies this but the mixing recommendation for washing (vortex 5 sec or roller 5 min) is less in duration than source original for resuspension step  
- Source details use of spin columns or disposable separation columns to remove free biotin or unincorporated biotinylated primers; protocol references ultrafiltration or cleanup but is less specific  
- The source reports Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin are not supplied in RNase-free solutions but must be washed for RNA use; protocol captures this partially but does not explicitly warn about potential RNase contamination risk  
- The recommended storage and handling conditions for beads (e.g., temperature, shelf life) are missing in protocol  
- Binding capacity numbers from table (e.g., pmol or µg per mg beads) are included but not referenced with units in every context (e.g. "binding capacity varies" is vague)  

## Possible Unsupported Claims
- None detected. All major protocol steps and claims appear supported by source text.

## Step Order / Omission Risks
- The protocol consolidates some washing steps and timing but generally follows source order closely.  
- Potential risk: the RNA application washing steps (two washes with Solution A for 2 min each) appear only as a general note under RNA applications and not integrated explicitly into a unified overall workflow, which may cause omission or misuse.  
- The source warns about avoiding air bubbles during pipetting—this is only briefly mentioned in notes and might be overlooked.  
- Source describes optimization by titration of beads and the use of up to two-fold excess of biotinylated molecules for saturation—protocol mentions but no detailed guidance, which may lead to suboptimal binding if not followed carefully.  
- Protocol omits mention of steric availability and charge interactions impacting binding capacity from source text, which could affect expectations.  
- Potential [CHECK]: centrifugation steps are not described; source is silent on centrifugation but protocol raises it in checklist—should be explicitly noted if absent.  
- The protocol instruction "Add equal volume of washing buffer (or at least 1 mL)" matches source but source also notes increased incubation time for diluted samples—protocol mentions increasing incubation or smaller batches, but this is easily overlooked and may pose risk of under-binding.

---

Summary: Protocol is generally comprehensive and reflects source, but some numeric details and guidelines on buffer composition, volumes, and RNase-free considerations are less explicit, potentially risking protocol reproducibility or RNA integrity. No unsupported claims detected but RNA-specific handling and salt concentration nuances deserve clearer emphasis.
