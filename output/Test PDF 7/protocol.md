# Dynabeads™ M-280 Streptavidin Coupling and Immobilization Protocol

## Objective
To provide detailed protocols for immobilizing biotinylated molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, and antibodies onto Dynabeads™ M-280 Streptavidin magnetic beads for various downstream applications.

## Materials
- Dynabeads™ M-280 Streptavidin (10 mg/mL in PBS pH 7.4 with 0.1% BSA, 0.02% sodium azide)
- DynaMag™ Magnet (e.g. Cat. No. 11205D, 11206D, 60210)
- Mixing device with tilting and rotation (e.g. HulaMixer™ Sample Mixer)
- Binding and washing buffers (see Table 1):
  - 1X B&W Buffer (PBS pH 7.4)
  - PBS/BSA (PBS pH 7.4 with 0.01% w/v BSA)
  - PBST (PBS pH 7.4 with 0.01% v/v Tween™-20)
  - Solution A (DEPC-treated 0.1 M NaOH, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.05 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA)
  - Solution B (2 M NaCl, DEPC-treated 0.1 M NaCl)
- Biotinylated molecules (e.g., peptides, proteins, antibodies, nucleotides, DNA/RNA)
- Distilled water
- Optional: detergent Tween™-20 (0.01–0.1%) to reduce non-specific binding

## Procedure

### General Preparation of Beads
1. Resuspend Dynabeads™ M-280 Streptavidin beads in the vial by vortexing for >30 seconds or tilting and rotating for 5 minutes.
2. Transfer the desired volume of beads to a new tube.
3. Add at least an equal volume of washing buffer (e.g., 1X B&W Buffer) and mix by vortexing for 5 seconds or by gentle rotation for at least 5 minutes.
4. Place the tube on a magnet for 1–2 minutes to separate beads and discard the supernatant.
5. Remove the tube from the magnet and resuspend the washed beads in washing buffer equal to the initial bead volume.

### Immobilization of Biotinylated Molecules

#### Nucleic Acids (DNA or RNA)
1. Wash beads twice in Solution A for 2 minutes each with the same volume of Solution A as beads.
2. Wash beads once in Solution B with the same volume.
3. Resuspend beads in Solution B to prepare for coupling.
4. Resuspend beads in 2X B&W Buffer to a final concentration of 5 µg/µL (double original volume).
5. Add an equal volume of biotinylated DNA/RNA diluted in distilled water to reduce NaCl concentration from 2 M to 1 M.
6. Incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature with gentle rotation.
   - For oligonucleotides <30 bases, incubation time is a maximum of 10 minutes.
   - For DNA fragments up to 1 kb, incubation time is 15 minutes.
7. Separate beads with a magnet for 2–3 minutes and discard the supernatant.
8. Wash beads 2–3 times with 1X B&W Buffer.
9. Resuspend beads in buffer with low salt concentration appropriate for downstream applications.

#### Antibodies/Proteins
1. Incubate beads with biotinylated antibodies or proteins in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature with gentle rotation.
2. Separate beads with a magnet for 2–3 minutes and discard supernatant.
3. Wash beads 4–5 times in PBS containing 0.1% BSA.
4. Resuspend beads to desired concentration for downstream applications.

## Notes
- Use up to a two-fold excess of binding capacity of the biotinylated molecule to saturate streptavidin.
- Keep tubes on the magnet for at least 2 minutes to ensure complete bead capture.
- Avoid air bubbles during pipetting.
- Free biotin in samples will reduce bead binding capacity.
- For diluted samples, increase incubation time or use smaller batches.
- Using detergents such as 0.01–0.1% Tween™-20 in buffers can reduce non-specific binding.
- Indirect target capture (mixing biotinylated molecules with sample before adding beads) may improve results for weak affinities or low molecule concentrations.
- Binding capacities per 1 mg beads (typical values):
  - Biotinylated peptides: ~200 pmol
  - Biotinylated antibodies: ~10 µg
  - Double-stranded DNA: ~10 µg
  - Single-stranded oligonucleotides: ~200 pmol
- For RNA applications, Dynabeads™ are not supplied in RNase-free solutions; perform washing steps accordingly.

## Review Flags

## Critical Parameters Checklist (from the protocol)
- Bead concentration for immobilization: 5 µg/µL (2X B&W Buffer)

  - 5 min tilting/rotation for bead resuspension
  - Nucleic acid binding incubation: 10 min max for oligos <30 bases; 15 min for DNA ≤1 kb
  - Protein/antibody coupling: 30 min at room temperature
  - Washing: twice 2 min washes in Solution A; one wash in Solution B (time given only for Solution A washes)
  - Magnetic separation: 1–2 min for general washing steps, 2–3 min for bead separations after binding
- Buffers and solutions:

  - Solution B: 2 M NaCl, DEPC-treated 0.1 M NaCl
  - 1X B&W Buffer (PBS pH 7.4)
  - PBS with 0.1% BSA (for antibody/protein washing)

- Magnetization step duration: 1–2 or 2–3 min depending on step
- Temperature: room temperature (implicit for all incubations)

## Potential Missing Parameters (compare to source)
- Washing time for Solution B wash during RNA application is missing in the protocol (SOURCE: wash once in Solution B, time not specified—only Solution A wash time given as 2 min)
- Explicit volume for incubation steps with biotinylated molecules is not always specified; the protocol mentions "add an equal volume" or "same volume," but original text gives “at least 1 mL” or “use same or larger volume” which may be ambiguous.
- The protocol lacks explicit mention of RNase-free handling precaution details beyond stating to wash for RNA applications
- Detergent concentration range in washing buffers optional phrase appears in notes but no clear step for adding Tween concentration 0.01–0.1% stated explicitly in washing steps

## Possible Hallucinations / Unsupported Claims
- None detected. All protocol steps and parameters appear supported by the source text.

## Step Order / Omission Risks
- The protocol omits specifying that for nucleic acid immobilization, initial bead washing is first according to "Wash Dynabeads™ magnetic beads" section (general washing), then a separate washing series with Solution A and B. The protocol conflates these into the "Nucleic Acids" section which could risk skipping initial washing steps.
- Incubation times for antibodies proteins and nucleic acids are given but range phrasing (e.g., 15–30 min for immobilization in general) is not consistently reflected in the protocol:
  - Source text: 15–30 min incubation for immobilization generally; protocol uses fixed 15 min for nucleic acids or 30 min for antibodies.
- The protocol states placing tube on magnet for 1–2 min for general washing but source suggests 2 min minimum to ensure bead capture; possible risk if minimum time shortened
- The protocol specifies vortexing 5 sec or rotation 5 min after adding washing buffer, source states “vortex 5 sec or keep on roller at least 5 min” — protocol uses “or gentle rotation” without minimum time specified
- No explicit mention of removal of free biotin by ultrafiltration/microdialysis or PCR primer cleanup for nucleic acid immobilization as mentioned in source; may affect binding efficiency but protocol only notes free biotin reduces binding capacity

---

Overall, the generated protocol is consistent with source text but would benefit from clearer specification of washing times, explicit mention of RNAse-free handling and free biotin removal, and careful note on magnet incubation times to avoid incomplete bead separation.
