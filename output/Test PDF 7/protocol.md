## Procedure

### General Preparation
1. Resuspend beads in the vial by vortexing >30 sec or tilting and rotating for 5 min.
2. Transfer the desired volume of beads to a new tube.
3. Wash beads:
   - Add an equal volume of suitable washing buffer (at least 1 mL).
   - Mix by vortexing for 5 sec or keep on a roller for at least 5 min.
4. Place the tube on the magnet for 1–2 min to collect beads and discard the supernatant.
5. Remove tube from magnet and resuspend beads in the washing buffer equal to the initial bead volume used.

### Immobilization of Biotinylated Molecules
1. Add biotinylated molecule solution to the washed beads.
2. Incubate for 15–30 min at room temperature with gentle rotation.
3. Place tube on magnet for 2–3 min and discard the supernatant.
4. Wash coated beads 3–5 times in appropriate washing buffer:
   - For nucleic acids: 1X B&W Buffer.
   - For proteins/antibodies: PBS containing 0.1% BSA.
5. Resuspend beads in a suitable buffer at desired concentration for downstream use.

### RNA Applications (Post-washing Protocol)
1. Wash beads twice in Solution A for 2 min each (use equal or larger volume than initial bead volume).
2. Wash beads once in Solution B using equivalent volume.
3. Resuspend beads in Solution B ready for coating with biotinylated molecules.

### Immobilization of Nucleic Acids
1. Resuspend beads in 2X B&W Buffer to 5 µg/µL.
2. Add an equal volume of biotinylated DNA/RNA diluted in distilled water to reduce NaCl from 2 M to 1 M.
3. Incubate 15 min at room temperature with gentle rotation.
4. Separate beads by magnet for 2–3 min; discard supernatant.
5. Wash 2–3 times with 1X B&W Buffer.
6. Resuspend beads in low-salt buffer suitable for downstream applications.

**Incubation Times for Nucleic Acids:**
- Short oligonucleotides (<30 bases): up to 10 min.
- DNA fragments up to 1 kb: 15 min.

### Immobilization of Antibodies/Proteins
1. Incubate beads and biotinylated antibodies in PBS for 30 min at room temperature with gentle rotation.
2. Separate beads by magnet for 2–3 min; discard supernatant.
3. Wash coated beads 4–5 times with PBS containing 0.1% BSA.
4. Resuspend beads in desired buffer and concentration.

## Notes
- Avoid air bubbles during pipetting.
- Free biotin reduces bead binding capacity; remove free biotin if necessary.
- Use up to two-fold excess of biotinylated molecule relative to beads’ binding capacity.
- Binding capacity varies with molecule size and conformation.
- For diluted samples, increase incubation time or isolate in smaller batches.
- Adding 0.01–0.1% Tween™ 20 can reduce non-specific binding during capture.
- Biotinylated target binding capacities (typical per mg beads):
  - Free Biotin: 650–900 pmol
  - Biotinylated peptides: ~200 pmol
  - Biotinylated antibodies: ~10 µg
  - ds DNA: ~10 µg
  - Ss oligonucleotides: ~200 pmol
- Dynabeads™ MyOne™ Streptavidin beads may be used for automation due to smaller size and higher magnetic mobility.
- For best results, optimize bead quantity and incubation time for each application.

## Review Flags

## Critical Parameters Checklist (from the protocol)
- Bead concentration for nucleic acid immobilization: 5 µg/µL in 2X B&W Buffer  
- Incubation times:  
  - General immobilization: 15–30 min at room temperature  
  - Nucleic acids: short oligonucleotides <30 bases up to 10 min; DNA up to 1 kb, 15 min  
  - Antibodies/proteins: 30 min at room temperature  
- Washing:  
  - Washing times: typically 1–5 min (mixing at least 5 min recommended)  
  - Number of washes: 3–5 times for coated beads  
  - RNA application washes: 2 × Solution A for 2 min, 1 × Solution B (times mentioned)  
- Volumes: equal volume of buffer to beads or at least 1 mL during washing  
- Magnet separation time: 1–3 min  
- Buffer compositions used explicitly (e.g., PBS pH 7.4, PBS/BSA 0.1%, Tween 0.01–0.1%)  
- Tween™ 20 concentration for reducing nonspecific binding: 0.01–0.1%  
- Free biotin removal recommended (no numeric detail)  
- Storage temperature for buffers: 2 to 8°C (from source but not re-stated in protocol)  

## Potential Missing Parameters (compare to source)
- Source specifies buffer pH ranges for binding/washing buffers typically 5–9; protocol only mentions pH 7.4 PBS based buffers without explicit pH variations  
- Salt concentration adjustment in immobilization step for nucleic acids: Source details dilution from 2 M to 1 M NaCl during nucleic acid immobilization. Protocol states this but lacks precision on starting buffer salt concentrations (Solution B details are fragmented, e.g., Solution B is 2 M NaCl in source but protocol states 2X B&W Buffer used to achieve 2 M NaCl) — may cause ambiguity.  
- The source mentions use of detergent Tween specifically for some applications with concentrations 0.01–0.1%, protocol correctly notes this but does not clarify when exactly addition during binding is recommended vs only in wash buffer  
- The source states beads contain ~6–7 × 10^8 beads/mL at 10 mg/mL, which affects binding capacity calculations; the protocol does not mention beads per mL or bead counts  
- Sample volume or total reaction volume is not always specified or suggested (e.g., no explicit total volume for immobilization or washing steps)  
- Source suggests that incubation time for bead resuspension is vortex >30 s or tilt/rotate 5 min; protocol specifies this but the mixing recommendation for washing (vortex 5 sec or roller 5 min) is less in duration than source original for resuspension step  
- Source details use of spin columns or disposable separation columns to remove free biotin or unincorporated biotinylated primers; protocol references ultrafiltration or cleanup but is less specific  
- The source reports Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin are not supplied in RNase-free solutions but must be washed for RNA use; protocol captures this partially but does not explicitly warn about potential RNase contamination risk  
- The recommended storage and handling conditions for beads (e.g., temperature, shelf life) are missing in protocol  
- Binding capacity numbers from table (e.g., pmol or µg per mg beads) are included but not referenced with units in every context (e.g. "binding capacity varies" is vague)  

## Possible Unsupported Claims
- None detected. All major protocol steps and claims appear supported by source text.

## Step Order / Omission Risks
- The protocol consolidates some washing steps and timing but generally follows source order closely.  
- Potential risk: the RNA application washing steps (two washes with Solution A for 2 min each) appear only as a general note under RNA applications and not integrated explicitly into a unified overall workflow, which may cause omission or misuse.  
- The source warns about avoiding air bubbles during pipetting—this is only briefly mentioned in notes and might be overlooked.  
- Source describes optimization by titration of beads and the use of up to two-fold excess of biotinylated molecules for saturation—protocol mentions but no detailed guidance, which may lead to suboptimal binding if not followed carefully.  
- Protocol omits mention of steric availability and charge interactions impacting binding capacity from source text, which could affect expectations.  
- Potential [CHECK]: centrifugation steps are not described; source is silent on centrifugation but protocol raises it in checklist—should be explicitly noted if absent.  
- The protocol instruction "Add equal volume of washing buffer (or at least 1 mL)" matches source but source also notes increased incubation time for diluted samples—protocol mentions increasing incubation or smaller batches, but this is easily overlooked and may pose risk of under-binding.

---

Summary: Protocol is generally comprehensive and reflects source, but some numeric details and guidelines on buffer composition, volumes, and RNase-free considerations are less explicit, potentially risking protocol reproducibility or RNA integrity. No unsupported claims detected but RNA-specific handling and salt concentration nuances deserve clearer emphasis.
