## Procedure

### 1. Preparation and Setup

#### 1.1 Unpacking
1. Check the packaging for damage.
2. Wear gloves and spray the packaging with ethanol.
3. Unpack the bioreactor under a cleanbench by tearing the groove at the top of the plastic bag.
4. Handle bioreactor carefully to avoid damage.

#### 1.2 Filling Culture Medium
1. Unscrew and remove the white blind plug from a Pg 13.5 port on the head plate.
2. Fill the sterile culture medium via pipette, pump, or funnel using the open port.
   - Recommended initial volume: 
     - Cell culture: approx. 100 mL
     - Microbiology: 65–70 mL
3. Close the Pg 13.5 port with the blind plug or install a calibrated, pre-sterilized pH sensor.

#### 1.3 Installing pH Sensors
1. Calibrate the pH sensors according to the DASware Control User Manual.
2. Sterilize the calibrated sensors (e.g. autoclaving).
3. Under the cleanbench, screw the pH sensor into a Pg 13.5 port on the head plate.

#### 1.4 Installing Optical Fiber for Optical pH Spot
1. Use a compatible optical fiber with the correct sensor length.
2. Insert the optical fiber into the pH cap until it snaps into place without force.
3. The fiber tip must contact the inner bottom of the pH cap.
4. Connect the optical fiber to the controller.
5. Calibrate the sensor using the data on the product label.
6. Follow specific guidelines to avoid sensor damage (avoid pH extremes, exposure to light, cold media, solvents, etc.).

#### 1.5 Integrating DO and Temperature Sensors
1. Store DO and temperature sensors connected to DASbox when not in use.
2. Keep DO sensor membrane moist using a sponge wetted with deionized water inside a storage box.
3. Prior to installation, add a few drops of water to the DO sensor port.
4. Insert the DO sensor to full depth until the handle locks and stretches the permeable membrane about 2–3 mm.
5. Insert the Pt100 RTD temperature sensor fully into the thermowell without force.
6. Handle sensors carefully to avoid damage.

#### 1.6 Assembling the Exhaust Condenser
1. Insert the condenser adapter into the exhaust condenser mounting on the head plate.
2. Press the preinstalled exhaust gas tube into the adapter groove.
3. Slide the tube insulation onto the adapter to the stop.
4. Attach the actuator above the magnetic plate; this activates cooling automatically.
5. Remove the actuator after cultivation to deactivate cooling.
6. Position the bioreactor securely in the DASbox before attaching condenser to avoid tipping (top-heavy).

#### 1.7 Assembling Overhead Drive
1. Position the bioreactor in a DASbox well to ensure stability.
2. Never place overhead drives onto magnetic couplings during operation.
3. Align slots and place the overhead drive on the magnetic coupling on the head plate.
4. Magnetic coupling connects the stirring shaft to the overhead drive.

#### 1.8 Connecting Liquids and Gas Supply
1. Remove luer caps from media feeding ports and tubing.
2. Connect luer connectors aseptically.
3. Insert gassing tubes (PA, AD 4 mm) into the inlet filter luer port.
4. Ensure secure and leak-free connection.
5. Do not use corrosive, toxic, flammable, or explosive gases.
6. Max operating gas pressure: 0.4 bar; prevent blockages or kinks in outlet gas tubing.
7. Wear PPE, especially protective goggles, when handling the bioreactor.

### 2. Cultivation Process

#### 2.1 Typical Sequence for Cell Culture
1. Unpack bioreactor.
2. Fill culture medium.
3. Install pH sensor.
4. Add inoculum via pipette or pump.
5. Connect liquid reservoirs with feed and pH adjustment media.
6. Transport bioreactor and reservoirs to the DASbox.
7. Integrate DO and temperature sensors.
8. Connect pH sensor.
9. Mount exhaust condenser.
10. Connect gas supply.
11. Mount overhead drive.
12. Adjust cultivation conditions and perform DO calibration.
13. Start cultivation via software.
14. Upon completion, dispose of bioreactor properly.

#### 2.2 Typical Sequence for Microbiology
1. Unpack bioreactor.
2. Fill culture medium.
3. Install pH sensor.
4. Connect reservoirs with liquids.
5. Transport bioreactor and reservoirs to the DASbox.
6. Integrate DO and temperature sensors.
7. Connect pH sensor.
8. Mount exhaust condenser.
9. Connect gas supply.
10. Mount overhead drive.
11. Adjust cultivation conditions and perform DO calibration.
12. Inoculate via sampling valve or sterile workbench.
13. Start cultivation via software.
14. Upon completion, dispose of bioreactor properly.

### 3. Sampling
1. Remove screw cap from sampling valve and disinfect with ethanol.
2. Connect a sterile luer lock syringe to the valve.
3. Valve opens as syringe is connected.
4. Aspirate sample carefully.
5. Disinfect valve and close with luer cap after sampling.
6. Never use a needle to penetrate the sampling valve.
7. Remove the first mL (dead volume) before repeat sampling.

### 4. Disposal
1. Remove and keep reusable parts.
2. Empty single-use bioreactor and place it in an autoclave bag.
3. Do not autoclave bioreactor containing culture broth.
4. Follow applicable local regulations for disposal.
5. Wear PPE and use gloves when handling components.

### 5. Troubleshooting Magnetic Coupling
1. If grinding noise or plastic wear occurs, height is too low.
2. If stirring is interrupted, height may be too high.
3. Loosen set screw with 1.5 mm Allen key.
4. Adjust magnetic adapter height to minimum effective distance without friction.
5. Tighten set screw after adjustment.

## Notes

- The single-use bioreactor is delivered pre-sterilized in double packaging via irradiation sterilization.
- Do not expose the bioreactor material (SMMA) to temperatures above 80 °C or harsh chemicals as indicated.
- Maximum operating temperatures: 40 °C (BioBLU 0.3c), 45 °C (BioBLU 0.3f).
- Maximum contact temperature (heat blankets, wells): 60 °C.
- Bioreactor should never be exposed to negative pressure; ensure proper venting and gassing during liquid pumping.
- Maximum pressure inside bioreactor: 0.4 bar.
- Avoid abrupt stirring startup to prevent damage.
- Store and handle all components with care; membranes and seals are sensitive.
- Avoid UV and direct sunlight exposure; store in original packaging.
- Additional instructions and calibration details are available in DASware Control User Manual and DASbox Operating Manual.
- Handle biological, chemical, and physical hazards according to local regulations and wear appropriate PPE.
