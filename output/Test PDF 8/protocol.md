13. Start cultivation process (refer DASware Control User Manual).  
14. Dispose of bioreactor after cultivation (4.2.11).

### 2.2 Unpacking

- Check packaging for damage.  
- Wear gloves.  
- Spray packaging with ethanol before placing under cleanbench.  
- Open sterile double packing by tearing groove at top under cleanbench to avoid contamination.

### 2.3 Filling Culture Medium

- Unscrew and remove white blind plug from Pg 13.5 port.  
- Fill sterilized culture medium via pipette, pump, or funnel: approx. 100 mL (cell culture) or 65–70 mL (microbiology).  
- Close Pg 13.5 port with blind plug or insert calibrated and sterilized pH sensor.

### 2.4 Installing pH Sensors

- Calibrate pH sensor per DASware Control User Manual.  
- Sterilize sensor (e.g., autoclaving).  
- Screw sensor into Pg 13.5 port under cleanbench.

### 2.5 Installing Optical Fiber for Optical pH Spot

- Use sensor length compatible with bioreactor version.  
- Insert optical fiber at "pH" labeled cap until it snaps into place, ensuring contact with inner bottom of pH cap.  
- Avoid excessive force to prevent displacing pH cap.  
- Connect optical fiber to controller as per controller manual.  
- Note sensor measurement range: official pH 5.5 – 8.0, recommended 6.5 – 7.5.  
- Avoid exposing optical pH spot to pH outside sensor range or to direct sunlight/UV, low osmolarity media, solvents, and fluorescent substances.

### 2.6 Integrating DO and Temperature Sensors

- Store DO sensor in humidified atmosphere upright in black screw box with sponge wetted with deionized water.  
- Before insertion, add a few drops of water into DO sensor port to wet the membrane.  
- Insert DO sensor fully until handle engages, stretching permeable membrane 2–3 mm.  
- Insert Pt100 RTD temperature sensor carefully into thermowell to the stop without force to avoid damage.  
- Never activate temperature control without RTD sensor inserted and the bioreactor filled to minimum working volume.  
- Handle sensors carefully to avoid membrane or cap damage.

### 2.7 Assembling Exhaust Condenser

- Insert condenser adapter into holder on head plate gently to avoid cracking.  
- Press preinstalled exhaust gas tube into groove of condenser adapter.  
- Push tube insulation onto condenser adapter to stop.  
- Slide actuator onto magnetic plate; correct position activates cooling automatically.  
- Remove actuator to deactivate cooling after cultivation.  
- Position bioreactor in DASbox well before assembling off-gas condenser to prevent tipping due to top-heaviness.

### 2.8 Assembling Overhead Drive

- Do not place overhead drive on magnetic coupling while drive is operating to avoid damage.  
- Position bioreactor in DASbox well for stability due to increased top-heaviness.  
- Place overhead drive on magnetic coupling in center of head plate, aligning slots for proper position.

### 2.9 Connecting Dispensing Media and Gas Supply

- Remove luer caps and connect tubing aseptically to liquid addition ports.  
- Insert DASbox PA tubes (AD 4 mm) into luer ports of inlet gas filters.  
- Ensure secure, straight fitting of connections to prevent leakages.  
- Do not use corrosive, explosive, flammable, or toxic gases.  
- Do not exceed maximum pressure of 0.4 bar; never block outlet gas tubes or filters.  
- Confirm exhaust filter ventilation and use overpressure valves if applicable.

### 2.10 Sampling

- Remove screw cap and spray sampling valve with ethanol.  
- Attach luer lock syringe; compression opens valve.  
- Withdraw sample carefully.  
- Disinfect valve with ethanol and close with luer cap after sampling.  
- Do not penetrate valve with needles.  
- Remove first 1 mL dead volume when performing repeat sampling.  
- Sampling valve also usable for inoculation.

### 2.11 Proper Disposal

- Disassemble reusable accessories.  
- Empty bioreactor and place in autoclave bag.  
- Do NOT autoclave bioreactor with culture broth or filled.  
- Follow national regulations for disposal of biologically active substances.  
- Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) and protective gloves when handling.

### 3. Troubleshooting

3.1 Adjusting Magnetic Coupling of Overhead Drive

- Use 1.5 mm Allen key to loosen set screw on magnetic adapter.  
- Adjust height to avoid contact with plastic coupling (too low) or coupling interruptions (too high).  
- Ensure magnetic adapter does not rub against bioreactor coupling.  
- Tighten set screw after adjustment.

## Notes
- Handle bioreactors and sensors carefully due to fragile components and sensitive membranes.  
- Bioreactor top-heaviness increases with exhaust condenser and overhead drive assembly—ensure placement stability.  
- Avoid operation outside application limits, especially temperature and pressure.  
- Avoid contact with concentrated acids, bases, specific antifoams, solvents, and low chemical resistance substances as detailed.  
- Store bioreactors in original packaging, upright, at 15–25 °C, avoiding UV and strong temperature fluctuations.  
- Maximum process temperature: 40 °C (BioBLU 0.3c), 45 °C (BioBLU 0.3f).  
- Maximum contact temperature (heat blanket/wells): 60 °C.  
- Maximum pressure: 0.4 bar, minimum pressure: 0.0 bar (avoid negative pressure).  
- Use recommended antifoam agents based on siloxanes.  
- Perform all sensor calibrations prior to installation.  
- Work under sterile conditions to maintain bioreactor sterility.

## Potential Missing Parameters (compare to source)

- The protocol does not explicitly mention working volume minimums (source states 100 - 250 mL for cell culture, 65 - 250 mL for microbiology).  
- No numeric details on gas flow rates for gassing or headspace overlay flows (source references gas flow management for preventing negative pressure with pump flow rate + 10%, but exact flow values or recommendations missing).  
- No mention of maximum recommended operation duration (14 days) noted in source specs.  
- No explicit numeric values for DO sensor insertion depth or membrane stretch (2-3 mm stretch mentioned in source but not detailed in protocol).  
- No specific instructions on how to handle or limit UV exposure numerically (only general warnings).  
- No specification of sterilization dose (kGy) or shelf life expiry durations, only generic reference to label.  
- No explicit mention of pressure limiting devices or overpressure valve settings (only recommendations).  
- No precise instructions on inoculum volume or stirring ramping profiles.  
- Centrifugation parameters are not present (mentioned only in checklist as [CHECK]).

## Possible Unsupported Claims

- None detected. The protocol closely follows and cites source text sections without adding unsupported information.

## Step Order / Omission Risks

- None detected; step orders in the protocol align with source sections 4.2.1 and related subsections.  
- The protocol includes cautions about sensor membrane damage and emphasizes sterile technique consistent with the source.  
- The detail about removing dead volume before repeat sampling is consistent and well placed.  
- Inclusion of warnings about top-heaviness and stability precautions occur in correct order.  
- No obvious omission of critical assembly or operation steps found.

# Summary

The generated protocol comprehensively covers the main parameter values and SOP steps present in the source text with appropriate warnings and cautions. A few numeric details (e.g., exact minimum volumes, gas flow rates, use duration limits) and some measured insertion specifics are not given in numeric detail, which could be important for precise operation in some contexts. These do not pose immediate safety risks if operators consult the full manual but should be noted as areas for further detail.

No unsupported claims or incorrect step sequences were detected. The protocol is suitable for instructional use with the caveat that the flagged numeric and procedural details may require explicit confirmation or supplementation for rigorous process control.
