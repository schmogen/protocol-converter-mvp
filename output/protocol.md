# Corning® Matrigel® Basement Membrane Matrix for 3D Culture In Vitro Protocol

## Objective
To culture MDCK cells in a three-dimensional (3D) environment using Corning Matrigel basement membrane matrix, enabling the formation of on-top and embedded 3D cultures for subsequent analysis such as immunostaining and confocal microscopy.

## Materials
- MDCK cell line (ATCC CCL-34, Canis familiaris kidney cell line)
- Corning Matrigel matrix (Corning Cat. No. 356234)
- MEM (Corning Cat. No. 10-009-CV)
- FBS (Corning Cat. No. 35-015-CV)
- PBS (Corning Cat. No. 21-040-CV)
- 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA (Corning Cat. No. 25-053-Cl)
- 24-well plate (Corning Cat. No. 3524)

## Procedure

### Protocol 1: On-top MDCK 3D Culture
1. Thaw Matrigel matrix overnight by submerging the vial in a 4°C refrigerator. Swirl vial gently to disperse material.
2. Add 200 μL of Matrigel matrix (8 to 11 mg/mL) into each well of a pre-chilled 24-well plate. Spread evenly with a pipet tip.
3. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 minutes to allow the Matrigel matrix to gel.
   - **Note:** Pre-chill all cultureware/media contacting Matrigel matrix. Keep Matrigel matrix on ice during handling. Avoid overdrying during gelation.
4. Wash MDCK cells once with PBS. Trypsinize cells to single-cell suspension and pellet by centrifugation at 125 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature (RT).
   - **Note:** Use cells healthy and under 85% confluency. Pipet vigorously to dissociate cell clumps.
5. Resuspend cells in MDCK complete medium (MEM + 10% FBS) to 3 × 10^5 cells/mL. Plate 250 μL cell suspension per well on top of gelled Matrigel.
6. Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
7. Chill MDCK complete medium on ice. Add Matrigel matrix to 10% of final volume for a final concentration of 0.8 to 1.1 mg/mL.
8. Gently add 250 μL of chilled Matrigel matrix medium mixture to each well by pipetting down the side to avoid disturbing cells.
   - **Note:** Ensure medium is cold before Matrigel addition for even mixing and deposition.
9. Culture continuously for 4 to 7 days.
10. Replace Matrigel matrix medium mixture every 2 days.
11. Immunostaining and confocal microscopy are recommended for assessing 3D cultures.

### Protocol 2: Embedded MDCK 3D Culture
1. Thaw Corning Matrigel matrix overnight on ice in a 4°C refrigerator. Swirl vial gently to disperse material.
2. On Day 0, dilute Matrigel matrix to 5 mg/mL with ice-cold MDCK complete medium (MEM + 10% FBS).
   - **Note:** Keep all cultureware and reagents cold during handling.
3. Using pre-chilled tips, coat each well of a pre-chilled 24-well plate with 100 μL of 5 mg/mL Matrigel matrix.
4. Spread evenly and incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes to form a gel.
   - **Note:** Avoid overdrying during gelation.
5. Trypsinize MDCK cells from monolayer to single-cell suspension, and pellet by centrifugation at 125 x g for 5 minutes at RT.
   - **Note:** Use healthy cells under 85% confluency. Pipet vigorously to dissociate clumps.
6. Resuspend cells in MDCK complete medium and adjust to 5 × 10^6 cells/mL.
7. Mix 30 μL of cell suspension with 270 μL of 5 mg/mL Matrigel matrix on ice to achieve final cell density of 5 × 10^5 cells/mL.
   - **Note:** Cell suspension should not exceed 10% of Matrigel volume to preserve gel polymerization. Cell number may require optimization.
8. Incubate the mixture in the pre-coated wells at 37°C for 30 to 45 minutes to gel.
9. Gently add 500 μL MDCK complete medium to each well.
10. Culture for 8 to 10 days.
11. Change medium every 2 days.
12. Immunostaining and confocal microscopy are recommended for analysis.

## Notes
- Always keep Matrigel matrix and related materials cold until gelation.
- Avoid overdrying or disturbing Matrigel matrix during gel formation steps.
- Cell density and plating volume may require optimization depending on cell line growth properties.
- Use cells that are healthy and not more than 85% confluent.
- Vigorously pipet cells to ensure a single-cell suspension before plating.
- Immunostaining and confocal microscopy are recommended to assess 3D cultures.
